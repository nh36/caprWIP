"""Regression for the SC010 *w-gemination repair and hay's reconstruction depth.

Governing memo:
Germanic/docs/sound_changes/audits/sc010-w-gemination-and-hay-depth-adjudication.md

Protected scientific conclusions:

  * CAPR implements the Ringe-Taylor/Campbell architecture, not Fulk's.
    PGmc singleton *wj geminates to *wwj by the ordinary West Germanic
    gemination law, and pre-OE then resolves *awwj to *auj.
    Campbell §407 p. 167: "every consonant except r being affected after
    short syllables... The forms in which w is doubled are dealt with in
    §120.2."  Ringe and Taylor p. 53: "it appears that that cluster too
    underwent gemination in PWGmc."
  * hay's selected Proto-Germanic input must carry a SINGLETON *w. The old
    *xáwwją encoded a West Germanic geminate in a Proto-Germanic slot, which
    no source reconstructs: R&T p. 53 give *hawja, Campbell §120.2 p. 46
    gives *hawja-, and Kroonen p. 215 gives *hauja-.
  * The general invariant: a selected Proto-Germanic input must not
    pre-encode a West Germanic change that the cascade itself models.
  * SC010 supplies the geminate, SC029 resolves it, SC030 fronts the result.
    The reconstructed intermediate is exposed, not telescoped away.
  * SC029's singleton branches were an artifact of hay's bad protoform and
    are gone. The surviving pair are stress-notation variants.
  * The *w branch is not a hay-specific exception: it uses the same
    environment as the other thirteen members, and genuine non-members must
    stay out of its domain.

Firing populations and absolute rule positions are deliberately NOT frozen
here; they come from the generated census. Only rule identity, the corpus
invariant, and the derivational chain are protected.
