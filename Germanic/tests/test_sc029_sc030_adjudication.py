"""Regression for the joint SC029/SC030 adjudication (2026).

Governing memo:
Germanic/docs/sound_changes/audits/sc029-sc030-awj-resolution-and-au-fronting-adjudication.md

Protected scientific conclusions:

  * SC029 is NOT "glide formation". It is the reversal of the West Germanic
    gemination of *w before *j, restoring the diphthong: PNWGmc *awj >
    PWGmc *[aw'w'] > pre-OE *[auj] (Ringe and Taylor p. 53 §3.1.3, "it was
    reversible"; Campbell §120.2 p. 46, "auj > auuj > auj").
  * SC030 is NOT an independent Old English fronting. It is Anglo-Frisian
    brightening applied to the first element of the diphthong *au
    (Campbell §132 p. 52 lists "West Gmc. a > OE ae; West Gmc. au > OE aeu"
    as one and the same ordered step; Fulk §4.12 p. 73, "This fronting of a
    applied also to the diphthong au in OE").
  * SC030's scope is English, not Anglo-Frisian: Old Frisian has a with no
    fronting (OE eac, eage, beam : OFris ak, age, bam), and OE geac has a
    palatalized initial where OFris gak has none (Fulk §4.12 p. 73).
  * They are TWO changes and SC029 feeds SC030: "These new *au also
    underwent the development to ea" (Ringe and Taylor p. 173).
  * SC030's historical identity comes from INHERITED *au, which supplies 16
    of its 18 live firings. `hay` and `strew` are 2 further inputs and must
    never be treated as defining the rule.
  * The old registry claim that SC029/SC030 are "post-AF-brightening"
    developments placed too early is RETRACTED. SC030 is contemporaneous
    with SC043, and their domains are provably disjoint, so the executable
    order is free and no reorder is required.
  * Verdict RETAIN for both: no rule change, no move, no output change.

The complete firing populations are deliberately NOT frozen here; they come
from the generated census. Only the scientifically load-bearing witnesses and
the rule identities are protected.
