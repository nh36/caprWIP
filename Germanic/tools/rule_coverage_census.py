"""Machine-readable corpus-coverage census for the historical sound changes.

SCOPE (explicit design decision, 2026 pass 3): the census covers the
historical sound changes of the NUMBERED SC cascade (cascade_position 1-95
in the executable model) — registry rows with entry_type
historical_sound_change whose fst_identifier is a numbered stage. Historical
executable stages OUTSIDE the numbered span (e.g. SC002 PGmcGmSimplification
in the pre-cascade consonant prelude) are deliberately out of scope; this
matches the corpus-maturation pass-01 audit domain and the
cascade_position-keyed schema. A guard test pins this scope.

Executable identity comes from the registry (sc_registry.tsv sc_id ->
fst_identifier); the inventory view's rule_source_anchor is documentation
only. Membership and position come from oe_pipeline. For every rule in
scope the census records:

  * corpus_firing_count — how many selected corpus derivations the rule
    changes, read from the STAGE FIRING SUMMARY of the committed full trace
    report (docs/debug_snapshots/oe_full_trace_report.txt);
  * lexical_witnesses — the corpus lexemes it fires on;
  * coverage_status — one of:
        witnessed                   fires on at least one selected corpus row
        synthetic_only              historically genuine; zero corpus firings;
                                    validated by synthetic unit controls only
        historically_obscured       genuine but its corpus effect is masked by
                                    later developments (explicit override)
        disputed_or_research_issue  witnessing evidence is itself under
                                    adjudication (explicit override)

The project invariant is NOT "every rule fires": it is that every in-scope
historical rule's corpus-coverage status is explicit and understood
(corpus-maturation pass 01). Regenerate with:
