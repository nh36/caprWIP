"""Machine-readable rename migration manifest for the canonical-ontology relabel.

Behaviour-neutral migration only. Each row pairs a rule's former identifier /
display / stage / scope with its canonical target under the CAPR stage+scope
ontology (PGmc -> PNWGmc -> PWGmc -> EAF -> OE for stage; a separate hist_scope
axis). Former fields are a FROZEN pre-migration snapshot (FORMER below) so they
cannot drift as the live registry is migrated rule-by-rule; the canonical targets
are encoded in RENAMES below.

migration_status values: pending | completed | deferred | not_required
As each rule migrates, add its sc_id -> commit SHA to COMPLETED below (or leave
the SHA empty until final canonicalization); its migration_status then reports
completed. Deferred / not_required rules are fixed. This generator is
self-contained and reproducible: re-running never reads the (mutating) live
staging map for former values.
