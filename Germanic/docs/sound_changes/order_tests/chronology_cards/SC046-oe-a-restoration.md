# SC046 OE A Restoration — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `46`
- rule_name: `OEARestoration`
- safe computational window: `44-47`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `43`
- crossed stage: `SC043` Anglo Frisian Brightening
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `19`
- representative failures: `bake; fare; flask; grave; haw`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*bákaną` yields expected OE `bacan`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `bæcan`; PGmc `*fáraną` likewise yields `færan` instead of expected `faran`
- interpretation: SC046 can move earlier safely through order `44`, but it cannot move earlier across SC043. If OE A Restoration is moved before the brightening/fronting relation has settled, the derivation leaves these forms fronted where the live order restores them to back-vowel outcomes.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `48`
- crossed stage: `SC048` OE Secondary Nasalization
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `7`
- representative failures: `bake; fare; grave; lade; wade`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*bákaną` yields expected OE `bacan`, but the later-shifted variant yields `bæcan`; PGmc `*wádaną` likewise yields `wædan` instead of expected `wadan`
- interpretation: SC046 can move later safely through order `47`, but it cannot move later across SC048. Once OE A Restoration is delayed beyond OE Secondary Nasalization, the live restored/back-vowel outcomes are lost and the same derivations surface with fronted vowels.

## Chronology statement
SC046 must follow `SC043` Anglo Frisian Brightening. If OE A Restoration is moved before that stage, PGmc `*bákaną` yields `bæcan` rather than expected OE `bacan`, and PGmc `*fáraną` yields `færan` rather than `faran`, because the rule has been moved ahead of the brightening/fronting relation that the live order subsequently restores. SC046 must also precede `SC048` OE Secondary Nasalization: if OE A Restoration is delayed beyond that stage, PGmc `*bákaną` again yields `bæcan` instead of `bacan`, and PGmc `*wádaną` yields `wædan` instead of `wadan`, so the restored back-vowel outcomes are no longer preserved.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable rather than technical. The rule is not pinned to its immediate left edge: moving SC046 one step earlier across `SC044` changes several outputs such as `feallan | fēallan`, but those remain changed-still-passing forms rather than real failures, so the first earlier historical break is the next step at SC043.
