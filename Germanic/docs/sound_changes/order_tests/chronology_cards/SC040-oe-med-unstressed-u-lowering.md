# SC040 OE Med Unstressed U Lowering — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `40`
- rule_name: `OEMedUnstressedULowering`
- safe computational window: `40-71`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `39`
- crossed stage: `SC039` OE WI Combinative U Umlaut
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `widow`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*wíduwōn` yields expected OE `wuduwe`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `wudowe`
- interpretation: SC040 cannot move earlier across SC039. Pulling OE Med Unstressed U Lowering ahead of OE WI Combinative U Umlaut leaves the wrong unstressed vowel sequence in the `widow` derivation.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `72`
- crossed stage: `SC072` OE Unstressed Long Vowel Shortening
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `youth`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*júgunθ` yields expected OE `ġeoguþ`, but the later-shifted variant yields `ġeogoþ`
- interpretation: SC040 can move later safely through order `71`, but it cannot move later across SC072. Delaying OE Med Unstressed U Lowering that far forward leaves the wrong unstressed vowel in the `youth` derivation.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence places SC040 after `SC039` OE WI Combinative U Umlaut and before `SC072` OE Unstressed Long Vowel Shortening. If OE Med Unstressed U Lowering is moved before `SC039`, PGmc `*wíduwōn` yields `wudowe` rather than expected OE `wuduwe`. If it is moved later than `SC072`, PGmc `*júgunθ` yields `ġeogoþ` rather than expected `ġeoguþ`. The earlier side reciprocates `SC039` later, while the later side is historically real but broad/far across `SC072`.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable. The earlier side is a tight local reciprocal relation with `SC039`; the later side is real but far enough away that it should not be narrated as a local adjacency claim.
