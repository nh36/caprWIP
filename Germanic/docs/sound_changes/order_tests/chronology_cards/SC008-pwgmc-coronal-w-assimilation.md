# SC008 PWGmc Coronal W Assimilation — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `8`
- rule_name: `PWGmcCoronalWAssimilation`
- safe computational window: `4-30` (earlier side boundary-only; later side broad/far)
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: `none found before tested-chain boundary at SC014 (left-edge boundary; last_safe_order=4)`
- crossed stage: `SC014` NWGmc Unstressed Ai Monophthongization
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `0`
- representative failures: `none`
- concrete failure example: `none — no earlier real break was found before the tested-chain boundary`
- interpretation: The expanded-PWGmc first-break profile can move SC008 earlier safely to order `4`; the next earlier step crosses the SC014 head boundary and is out of range for this profile. This is therefore a boundary-only result rather than an earlier historical boundary for PWGmc Coronal W Assimilation.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `31`
- crossed stage: `SC031` OE WW Simplification
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `four`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*fédwōr` yields expected OE `fēower`, but the later-shifted variant yields `fēowwer`
- interpretation: SC008 can move later safely through order `30`, but it cannot move later across SC031. Delaying PWGmc Coronal W Assimilation that far forward leaves the wrong doubled glide sequence in the `four` derivation.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence identifies one historically interpretable boundary for SC008. The earlier search moved safely to order `4` and then stopped at the SC014 left-edge boundary with no real break, so that side remains boundary-only. The later search does find a real historical boundary at `SC031` OE WW Simplification: if PWGmc Coronal W Assimilation is moved later than that stage, PGmc `*fédwōr` yields `fēowwer` rather than expected OE `fēower`. The later side is historically real but broad/far rather than a tight local adjacency claim.

## Caveats
This card is one-sided in current testing. The later boundary is historically interpretable, but it is broad/far, and the historical evidence for the rule itself remains concentrated in a very small witness set centered on `four` plus plural-pronominal material.
