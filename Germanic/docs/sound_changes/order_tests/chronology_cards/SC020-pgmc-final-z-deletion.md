# SC020 PGmc Final Z Deletion — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `20`
- rule_name: `PGmcFinalZDeletion`
- safe computational window: `20-39`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `19`
- crossed stage: `SC019` NWGmc Final Long O Raising
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `rest`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*rástōz` yields expected OE `ræste`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `rast`
- interpretation: SC020 cannot move earlier across SC019. Pulling PGmc Final Z Deletion ahead of NWGmc Final Long O Raising strips the expected final vocalism from the `rest` derivation.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `40`
- crossed stage: `SC040` OE Med Unstressed U Lowering
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `11`
- representative failures: `beaver; bough; cud; field; flood`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*bébruz` yields expected OE `befer`, but the later-shifted variant yields `befro`; PGmc `*kwéðuz` likewise yields `cwedo` instead of expected `cwedu`; PGmc `*félθuz` yields `feldo` instead of `feld`
- interpretation: SC020 can move later safely through order `39`, but it cannot move later across SC040. Delaying PGmc Final Z Deletion that far forward leaves a broad set of unwanted final `-o` outcomes in formerly baseline-matching derivations.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence places SC020 after `SC019` NWGmc Final Long O Raising and before `SC040` OE Med Unstressed U Lowering. If PGmc Final Z Deletion is moved before `SC019`, PGmc `*rástōz` yields `rast` rather than expected OE `ræste`. If it is moved later than `SC040`, PGmc `*bébruz` yields `befro` rather than `befer`, PGmc `*kwéðuz` yields `cwedo` rather than `cwedu`, and PGmc `*félθuz` yields `feldo` rather than `feld`, alongside eight other newly failing rows. The earlier side is historical and local and reciprocates `SC019` later around `rest`; the later side is historical but broad/far across `SC040`.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable. The later side is much broader than the earlier side and should not be narrated as a tight local adjacency claim.
