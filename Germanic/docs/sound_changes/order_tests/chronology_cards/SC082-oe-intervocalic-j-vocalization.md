# SC082 OE Intervocalic J Vocalization — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `81`
- rule_name: `OEIntervocalicJVocalization`
- safe computational window: `81-81`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `80`
- crossed stage: `SC081` OE J Strengthening After Front Diphthong
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `strew`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*stráwjaną` yields expected OE `strīeġan`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `strīeian`
- interpretation: SC082 cannot move earlier across SC081. Pulling OE Intervocalic J Vocalization ahead of OE J Strengthening After Front Diphthong vocalizes the expected strengthened consonant in the `strew` derivation.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `82`
- crossed stage: `SC083` OE Unstressed EI Contraction
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `8`
- representative failures: `bore; handle; learn; lick; make`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*búrōjaną` yields expected OE `borian`, but the later-shifted variant yields `boreian`; PGmc `*xándlōjaną` likewise yields `handleian` instead of expected `handlian`; PGmc `*mákōjaną` yields `maceian` instead of `macian`
- interpretation: SC082 cannot move later across SC083. Delaying OE Intervocalic J Vocalization past OE Unstressed EI Contraction preserves an extra `ei`-like sequence where the live chronology expects contracted `-ian` outcomes.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence places SC082 immediately after `SC081` OE J Strengthening After Front Diphthong and before `SC083` OE Unstressed EI Contraction. If OE Intervocalic J Vocalization is moved earlier than `SC081`, PGmc `*stráwjaną` yields `strīeian` rather than expected OE `strīeġan`. If it is moved later than `SC083`, PGmc `*búrōjaną` yields `boreian` rather than `borian`, PGmc `*xándlōjaną` yields `handleian` rather than `handlian`, and PGmc `*mákōjaną` yields `maceian` rather than `macian`, alongside five other newly failing rows. Both sides are therefore historically interpretable and reciprocal with their neighboring far-late stages.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable. The earlier side is narrow and centered on `strew`, while the later side is broader and concentrated in an eight-row verbal set.
