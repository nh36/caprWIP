# SC011 PWGmc Syllabic J — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `11`
- rule_name: `PWGmcSyllabicJ`
- safe computational window: `11-86` (earlier side local reciprocal; later side boundary-only)
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `10`
- crossed stage: `SC010` PWGmc J Gemination
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `net`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*nátją` yields expected OE `nett`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `nete`
- interpretation: SC011 cannot move earlier across SC010. Pulling PWGmc Syllabic J ahead of PWGmc J Gemination leaves the `net` derivation too light, so the earlier side is a tight local reciprocal boundary rather than a broad/far relation.

## Later boundary
- first later break: `none found before runner boundary at order 86`
- crossed stage: `SC087` OE R Metathesis
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change` (runner-boundary result)
- failure count: `0`
- representative failures: `none`
- concrete failure example: `none — no later real break was found before the runner boundary`
- interpretation: The expanded-PWGmc first-break profile can move SC011 later safely through order `86`, but it finds no later real break before the current SC087 search boundary. This is therefore a boundary-only result rather than a later historical boundary for PWGmc Syllabic J.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence identifies one historically interpretable local boundary for SC011. The earlier search breaks immediately at `SC010` PWGmc J Gemination: if PWGmc Syllabic J is moved earlier than that stage, PGmc `*nátją` yields `nete` rather than expected OE `nett`. The later search then continues through order `86` with no real break before the current SC087 boundary, so that side remains boundary-only. The earlier boundary reciprocates SC010 later and should be read as a local seam between the two rules.

## Caveats
This card is one-sided in current testing. The earlier boundary is tight and historically interpretable, but the current compact trace still gives SC011 no direct hit count of its own, so any later prose must keep the trace-light status visible.
