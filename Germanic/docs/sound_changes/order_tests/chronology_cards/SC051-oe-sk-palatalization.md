# SC051 OE Sk Palatalization — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `51`
- rule_name: `OESkPalatalization`
- safe computational window: `47-55`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `46`
- crossed stage: `SC046` OE A Restoration
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `2`
- representative failures: `flask; wash`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*fláskōn` yields expected OE `flasce`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `flæsċe`; PGmc `*wáskaną` likewise yields `wæsċan` instead of expected `wascan`
- interpretation: SC051 can move earlier safely through order `47`, but it cannot move earlier across SC046. Pulling OE Sk Palatalization ahead of OE A Restoration leaves these forms fronted where the live order keeps back-vowel outcomes.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `56`
- crossed stage: `SC056` OE Ws Palatal Diphthongization
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `5`
- representative failures: `shaft; shear; sheath; sheep; shield`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*skáftą` yields expected OE `sċeaft`, but the later-shifted variant yields `sċæft`; PGmc `*skéraną` likewise yields `sċeran` instead of expected `sċieran`
- interpretation: SC051 can move later safely through order `55`, but it cannot move later across SC056. Delaying OE Sk Palatalization beyond OE Ws Palatal Diphthongization loses the live `sċea-` / `sċie-` outcomes and replaces them with less developed forms.

## Chronology statement
SC051 must follow `SC046` OE A Restoration. If OE Sk Palatalization is moved before that stage, PGmc `*fláskōn` yields `flæsċe` rather than expected OE `flasce`, and PGmc `*wáskaną` yields `wæsċan` rather than `wascan`, because the rule has been pulled ahead of the restoration step that preserves the live back-vowel outcomes. SC051 must also precede `SC056` OE Ws Palatal Diphthongization: if it is moved later than that stage, PGmc `*skáftą` yields `sċæft` instead of `sċeaft`, and PGmc `*skéraną` yields `sċeran` instead of `sċieran`, so the live palatalized diphthongal outputs are lost.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable and fairly local. This rule is neither as broadly movable as SC059 nor as sharply pinned as SC045, but it does sit in a dense local interaction zone around SC046 and SC056.
