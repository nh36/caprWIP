# SC031 OE WW Simplification — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `31`
- rule_name: `OEWWSimplification`
- safe computational window: `14-33` (earlier side non-historical)
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `13`
- crossed stage: `PWGmcChanges`
- crossed stage type: `blocked_by_runner_limitation`
- failure count: `2`
- representative failures: `four; hay`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*fédwōr` yields expected OE `fēower`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `fēowwer`; PGmc `*xáwwją` likewise yields `hēai` instead of expected `hīeġ`
- interpretation: The first real computational break for SC031 appears only when the move reaches bundled `PWGmcChanges`. This is therefore not an ordinary earlier historical first-break boundary for OE WW Simplification.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `34`
- crossed stage: `SC034` OE Aw Long Diphthong
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `2`
- representative failures: `dew; hew`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*dáwwō` yields expected OE `dēaw`, but the later-shifted variant yields `dawu`; PGmc `*xáwwaną` likewise yields `hawan` instead of expected `hēawan`
- interpretation: SC031 can move later safely through order `33`, but it cannot move later across SC034. Delaying OE WW Simplification past OE Aw Long Diphthong restores the unsimplified `aw` sequence in `dew` and `hew`.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence identifies a later historical boundary for SC031 but not an earlier ordinary historical one. If OE WW Simplification is moved later than `SC034` OE Aw Long Diphthong, PGmc `*dáwwō` yields `dawu` rather than expected OE `dēaw`, and PGmc `*xáwwaną` yields `hawan` rather than `hēawan`. The earlier direction does produce a real computational break at order `13`, but that break crosses bundled `PWGmcChanges`, so it should be recorded as non-historical / runner-limited rather than as a normal chronology constraint. The later side reciprocates `SC034` earlier.

## Caveats
The earlier side must not be used as an ordinary must-follow claim about a specific historical stage. It records a real computational break, but only at the bundled `PWGmcChanges` boundary.
