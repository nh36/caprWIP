# SC074 OE Med Unstressed I Lowering1 — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `74`
- rule_name: `OEMedUnstressedILowering1`
- safe computational window: `73-74`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `72`
- crossed stage: `SC072` OE Unstressed Long Vowel Shortening
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `fright`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*fúrxtīnaz` yields expected OE `fyrhte`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `fyrhti`
- interpretation: SC074 can move earlier safely through order `73`, but it cannot move earlier across SC072. Pulling OE Med Unstressed I Lowering1 ahead of OE Unstressed Long Vowel Shortening leaves the `fright` derivation with final `-i` instead of the live `-e` outcome.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `75`
- crossed stage: `SC075` OE Med Unstressed I Lowering
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `1`
- representative failures: `shilling`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*skíllingaz` yields expected OE `sċilling`, but the later-shifted variant yields `sċilleng`
- interpretation: SC074 can move later safely through its current order, but it cannot move later across SC075. Delaying OE Med Unstressed I Lowering1 past OE Med Unstressed I Lowering produces the wrong medial vowel outcome in the `shilling` derivation.

## Chronology statement
Current first-break evidence places SC074 after `SC072` OE Unstressed Long Vowel Shortening and before `SC075` OE Med Unstressed I Lowering. If OE Med Unstressed I Lowering1 is moved before `SC072`, PGmc `*fúrxtīnaz` yields `fyrhti` rather than expected OE `fyrhte`; if it is moved later than `SC075`, PGmc `*skíllingaz` yields `sċilleng` instead of `sċilling`. The later side therefore directly reciprocates `SC075` earlier.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable, but the evidence is narrow and currently concentrated in one derivation on each side.
