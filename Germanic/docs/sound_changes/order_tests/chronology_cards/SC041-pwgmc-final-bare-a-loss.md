# SC041 PWGmc Final Bare A Loss — chronology evidence card

## Current position
- current_order: `41`
- rule_name: `PWGmcFinalBareALoss`
- safe computational window: `21-45`
- status: `first_break_complete`

## Earlier boundary
- first earlier break: order `20`
- crossed stage: `SC020` PGmc Final Z Deletion
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `64`
- representative failures: `beard; bosom; bottom; calf; coat`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*bárdaz` yields expected OE `beard`, but the earlier-shifted variant yields `bearda`; PGmc `*kámbaz` likewise yields `camba` instead of expected `camb`
- interpretation: SC041 can move earlier safely through order `21`, but it cannot move earlier across SC020. When final bare-a loss is moved too early, the derivation leaves a wide class of spurious `-a`-final outputs that the live chronology removes only after the earlier material around final `-z` has already been dealt with.

## Later boundary
- first later break: order `46`
- crossed stage: `SC046` OE A Restoration
- crossed stage type: `historical_sound_change`
- failure count: `7`
- representative failures: `craft; dale; day; hazel; mast`
- concrete failure example: PGmc `*kráftaz` yields expected OE `cræft`, but the later-shifted variant yields `craft`; PGmc `*dágaz` likewise yields `dag` instead of expected `dæġ`
- interpretation: SC041 can move later safely through order `45`, but it cannot move later across SC046. Delaying final bare-a loss changes the environment in which OE A Restoration operates, and the variant retains back-vowel outcomes where the live order yields the attested fronted forms.

## Chronology statement
SC041 must follow `SC020` PGmc Final Z Deletion. If PWGmc Final Bare A Loss is moved before that point, PGmc `*bárdaz` yields `bearda` rather than expected OE `beard`, and PGmc `*kámbaz` yields `camba` rather than `camb`, because the derivation is carrying final `-a` material forward instead of deleting it at the later point used by the live cascade. SC041 must also precede `SC046` OE A Restoration: if final bare-a loss is delayed until after restoration, PGmc `*kráftaz` yields `craft` instead of `cræft`, and PGmc `*dágaz` yields `dag` instead of `dæġ`, so the live fronted/restored outcomes are replaced by back-vowel forms.

## Caveats
Both observed boundaries are historically interpretable, because both crossed stages are `historical_sound_change` rows rather than technical markers or surface cleanup stages. The earlier boundary is far away and produces many failures at once, so it should be described as a broad computational limit rather than as a narrow local adjacency claim.
