# SC098 research dossier: early apocope of word-final short high vowels in unstressed words (PWGmc)

Branch `sc001-sc020-chronology-audit`, corpus-maturation pass 01. Companion
to `corpus-maturation-01-candidate-adjudication.md` §2 (YOU / OE *ēow*).
Written **before** implementation, per the standing governance rules (rule
changes require dossier-recorded secondary-source backing **and** proven
computational correctness).

## 1. The historical phenomenon

Proto-West Germanic lost word-final short high vowels early — well before
the familiar Old English high-vowel apocope (SC063) and, crucially, before
i-umlaut (SC055) — in two distinct environments. The first, loss in third
and later syllables, is already implemented as SC006
(`PWGmcEarlyIApocope`). The second is the subject of this dossier:

> "Short high vowels were also lost after heavy syllables in unstressed
> words, but the loss was not uniform either lexically or dialectally. Thus
> OE and 'and' < \*andi exhibits very early loss of \*-i, but OHG enti does
> not; neither OE ymbe 'around' nor OHG umbi exhibits early apocope; OE iow
> 'you (dat. pl.)' definitely does (since it does not exhibit i-umlaut), but
> OHG iu might or might not; and so on. Forms without apocope probably
> escaped this change because they were proclitic (and so not phonologically
> word-final) ... But it is also likely that this early apocope was variable
> in any case." [@RingeTaylor2014, §3.1.4, pp. 57–58]

Ringe & Taylor use exactly this change to license the doublet they print for
the second-person plural pronoun:

> "PGmc \*izwiz 'you (dat. pl.)' (Goth. izwis) > \*iwwi > PWGmc \*iuwi ~
> \*iuw (see 3.1.4) > OE īow, OF iū, OS, OHG iu"
> [@RingeTaylor2014, §3.1.1, pp. 41–42]

The OE reflex continues the **apocopated** variant \*iuw: had the \*-i
survived to the OE period it would have triggered i-umlaut, and it did not
(R&T's own argument, pp. 57–58). West Saxon *ēow* beside early WS and
Northumbrian *īow* [@Campbell1959, §702, p. 283 note] shows the normal
WS/non-WS treatment of the resulting diphthong; the corpus targets the WS
citation form *ēow*.

## 2. Contrast with fully stressed disyllables

The change must not be generalized to stressed disyllables. R&T's regular
third-syllable law (SC006) explicitly spares them: final short high vowels
"clearly were not lost in fully stressed disyllables, since \*i survived
long enough to cause i-umlaut in OE even after an initial heavy syllable"
[@RingeTaylor2014, §3.1.4, p. 55]. Corpus examples that depend on this
survival include \*gastiz-type i-stems (OE *ġiest*) and \*fūri (OE *fȳr*),
whose umlaut requires the \*-i to persist to SC055. Any implementation of
the unstressed-word loss must therefore leave stressed disyllables
untouched.

## 3. Stage and relative chronology

1. **After PWGmc final \*-z loss (SC020).** In \*izwiz the \*-i only becomes
   word-final once the following \*-z is lost; R&T's printed sequence
   (\*izwiz > \*iwwi) has the z-loss already applied [@RingeTaylor2014,
   pp. 41–42; z-loss: pp. 44–45]. SC020 **feeds** SC098.
2. **PWGmc era, before the post-PWGmc northern developments.** R&T discuss
   the loss among the PWGmc Auslautgesetze (§3.1.4) and print the
   apocopated variant as a PWGmc form ("PWGmc \*iuwi ~ \*iuw"). It also
   preceded the monophthongization of unstressed \*au ("loss of \*-i in
   these endings preceded the monophthongization of unstressed \*au")
   [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 57]. Executable slot: immediately after SC020,
   before SC097 (post-PWGmc) and SC003 (rhotacism).
3. **Before i-umlaut (SC055).** This is R&T's dating evidence itself: OE
   *ēow* shows no umlaut [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 57–58]. SC098 **bleeds**
   SC055 for this word.

## 4. Implementation and its honest limits

Adopted rule (composed in `EnglishProtoToOE` immediately after
`EAFFinalZDeletion`):

```foma
define PWGmcUnstressedWordFinalIApocope [
    {*i} -> 0 || {*w} {*w} _ .#.
];
```

Scoping rationale, recorded explicitly:

1. **The law is regular and prosodically conditioned.** Like Verner's law,
   it is governed by accent: word-final short high vowels dropped after
   heavy syllables in words that carried no word stress. R&T's apparent
   counterexamples are handled by their own proclisis account — proclitic
   forms "were not phonologically word-final" and so stood outside the
   law's environment [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 57–58]. This project is
   neogrammarian: we adopt the proclisis account as the systematic
   explanation and reject R&T's residual hedge that the loss "was variable
   in any case" — sentence-level accent placement, not lexical diffusion,
   decides which sandhi variant each language continues. The PWGmc doublet
   \*iuwi ~ \*iuw is regular sentence sandhi (stressed vs. unstressed
   sentence forms), and OE continues the unstressed variant, as its lack
   of i-umlaut proves.
2. The corpus's protoform notation cannot currently carry word-level
   stresslessness: rows such as \*kūi and \*fūri are stressed words whose
   orthography happens to lack an acute (no stressed long ū/ō symbols),
   so a "word contains no acute" guard would wrongly sweep them in —
   \*fūri must keep its \*-i to umlaut to *fȳr*, while a general
   heavy-syllable formulation would equally destroy \*gastiz-type umlaut
   (§2).
3. The rule is therefore stated through a **proxy environment** (cf. the
   SC096 convention): final \*-i after the geminate \*ww produced by
   SC008, which in the present corpus is exactly coextensive with the
   law's unstressed-word domain — the \*izwiz-pronoun class for which R&T
   print the apocopated PWGmc doublet \*iuw and the umlaut-free OE reflex
   [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 41–42, 57–58]. When future corpus additions
   bring in further unstressed-word lexemes covered by the law (e.g.
   *and* < \*andi), the proxy environment is to be widened so that it
   again matches the law's true domain.

This mirrors the precedent of SC096 (`RootNounNomZLoss`), where a regular
historical development whose true conditioning the notation cannot yet
express is implemented over an exactly coextensive proxy environment
rather than as a falsely general phonological law.

## 5. Interactions checked

1. **SC097 / SC003:** the rule's output ends in \*-ww; no final \*-z is
   created or destroyed, so the final-z corridor and rhotacism are
   unaffected.
2. **SC033/SC031 (downstream):** the surviving word-final geminate \*ww is
   vocalized by SC033 (`OEEwLongDiphthong`, extended to the word-final
   geminate context) before geminate simplification (SC031); see the
   modified `031-034-west-saxon-diphthong-chain.book-dossier.md`.
3. **SC055:** the trigger vowel is removed pre-umlaut, as the history
   requires (§3.3).

## 6. Computational validation

Sandbox compile of the full patched cascade in the backend container:

1. `ízwiz → ēow` (target: WS *ēow*);
2. `fédwōr → fēower` unchanged (the \*dw sibling of the Stiles class);
3. `xwáz → hwā`, `kūi → cȳ`, `fūri → fȳr`, `gastiz → ġiest` unchanged;
4. full regression of all 380 legacy protoforms against
   `cascade_baseline_outputs.tsv`: **0 differences** — the legacy-subset
   fingerprint `a72bdeb8…` is preserved.

## 7. Identifier allocation

`SC098` is the next free stable ID (SC096/SC097 allocated by the three-rule
programme; SC058 and SC077 are retired, not free). Proposed foma name:
`PWGmcUnstressedWordFinalIApocope`. Reader-facing name: "Early apocope in
unstressed words". Note: rule names are historic labels; numbering and
renaming across the cascade will be regularized later (author instruction).
