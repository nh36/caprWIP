# SC024 adjudication — the long *ē of 'sheep' and 'year': one rule, two sound changes

Registry-verdict: SC024=REFORMULATE/RETAIN

Status: adjudicated (this memo governs the outcome)
Scope: SC024 `PNWGmcLongELowering` only. SC025 is discussed where the
historical phenomenon requires it, but is not adjudicated here.
Verdict: **REFORMULATE the historical characterization (the rule
telescopes two historically distinct developments, and the claimed
pan-Northwest-Germanic scope of the *ǣ* outcome is wrong); RETAIN the
executable rule, its cascade position, the corpus, the chronology
edges, and both corpus fingerprints unchanged.**

## 0. The question

Before adjudication CAPR characterized SC024 as a single Proto-Northwest
Germanic sound change, "NWGmc Long E Lowering" (`hist_stage=pnwgmc`,
`hist_scope=pan_pnwgmc`, confidence A): stressed and unstressed long
`*ē`/`*ḗ` lower to `*ǣ` before a non-nasal consonant, at cascade
position 22 (between `PNWGmcNStemNLoss` and `PNWGmcLongENasalRounding`).
The chronology card records one interpretable boundary: SC024 < SC056
`OEWsPalatalDiphthongization`, witnessed by *sheep* and *year*; the
earlier side is runner-limited at bundled `PWGmcChanges`.

The hypothesis under test: is there really a coherent historical
*ē > *ǣ lowering at the Proto-Northwest Germanic stage, with
pan-Northwest-Germanic scope, conditioned by a following non-nasal
consonant? The answer is **no on stage, no on scope, and only
derivatively yes on conditioning** — yet the executable rule is a
deliberate, historically well-motivated proxy that should not change.

## 1. The historical phenomenon: two changes, not one

The vowel CAPR writes `*ē` in these lexemes is Proto-Germanic *ē₁
(PIE *eh₁/*ē). Its attested reflexes are:

- Gothic ⟨e⟩ /ē/: *ga-dēþs* 'deed', *slēpan* 'sleep', *mēna* 'moon',
  *nēþla* 'needle', *jēr* 'year';
- Old Norse á: *ráða*, *láta*, *mál*, *ár*, *nál*, *vápn*, *áll*, *hár*;
- Old High German ā: *tāt*, *slāfan*, *lāzan*, *rātan*, *māl*, *jār*,
  *nādala*, *āl*, *hār*, *bāra*, *nātara*;
- Old Saxon ā: *dād*, *slāpan*, *lātan*, *rādan*, *jār*, *māki*;
- Old English: WS ǣ (*dǣd*, *slǣpan*, *lǣtan*, *rǣdan*, *mǣl*, *nǣdl*,
  *ǣl*, *hǣr*, *bǣr*, *nǣdre*, *wǣpn*), Anglian/Kentish ē (*dēd*,
  *mēċe*), and before nasals ō (*mōna*, *mōnaþ*, *spōn*);
- Old Frisian ē (*dēd*, *jēr*), before nasals ō (*mōna*).

The comparative picture decomposes into **two sound changes**:

**(i) PNWGmc *ē₁ > *ā** — genuinely pan-Northwest-Germanic (Norse and
all of West Germanic; Gothic unaffected). This is the change that
actually deserves the name and stage in CAPR's old label. It is
epigraphically dated: Early Runic acc. sg. ᛗᚨᚲᛁᛃᚨ *mākija* 'sword'
(vs. Goth. *mēkeis*) shows *ā* "from the second half of the 2nd century
AD" (Grønvik 1998: 87, cited at Ringe & Taylor 2014: 12; word-list and
discussion R&T 2014: 11–13, including *jǣra- > *jāra- >* ON *ár*, OE
*ġēar* and *mǣkija- > *mākija-*).

**(ii) Anglo-Frisian fronting of non-nasalized long *ā > *ǣ/*ē** — a
much later, areally restricted development of the northern West
Germanic coast. Non-nasalized *ā (both from *ē₁ and from Gmc *ǣ
elsewhere) was fronted to WS ǣ, Anglian/Kentish and Old Frisian ē
(R&T 2014: 146–152, with the SC024 corpus items *slǣpan*, *wǣpen*,
*lǣtan*, *rǣdan*, *dǣd*, *ġēar*, *mǣl* among the examples; Campbell
1959: §128, pp. 50–51: *dǣd*, *hǣr*, *mǣg*, *bǣron*). Old Saxon and
Old High German keep ā — which is why the old registry claim
`pan_pnwgmc` for the *ǣ* outcome was false. The complementary **nasal
branch** of the same development is rounding of nasalized *ą̄ > ō
(*mōna*, *mōnaþ*, *spōn*, *cwōmon*, *nōmon*; R&T 2014: 142–144;
Campbell 1959: §127, p. 50) — that branch is CAPR's SC025.

**Scholarly dispute, recorded.** The two-step "detour" analysis
(*ē₁ > ā everywhere, then Anglo-Frisian re-fronting) is the majority
view, accepted by Ringe & Taylor (2014: 13–14, crediting Stiles 2004:
387–9 with the decisive *þǣr/hwǣr* lengthening argument) and going back
to Luick. A minority view (Wright; Bennett 1950; Grønvik 1981: 43–50,
1998: 87–9) holds that Anglo-Frisian *ǣ/ē* directly continues *ē₁
without an *ā* stage; Campbell is deliberately agnostic (1959: §129,
p. 51: "tempting to assume, though not definitely demonstrable"; §128
n. 1: "The question is far from decided"). CAPR's one-step executable
proxy `*ē → *ǣ` is compatible with **both** analyses for the Old
English line and therefore does not need to take a side; the registry
prose follows the majority two-step account while noting the dispute
here.

**Conditioning.** "Before a non-nasal consonant" is historically real,
but it belongs to phase (ii), not phase (i): phase (i) affected *ē₁
unconditionally, and the split is between nasalized *ą̄ (> ō, SC025)
and non-nasalized *ā (> ǣ, SC024). The SC024/SC025 environment split
is thus the genuine complementary conditioning of a single northern
West Germanic development — not an arbitrary CAPR implementation
boundary — but SC024 and SC025 are the two conditioned outcomes of
**one** development, not two independent sound changes. Additional
historical restrictions (fronting blocked before *w* + non-high-front
vowel, R&T 2014: 148–9; retraction before back vowels in Anglian) are
not represented because no corpus row requires them; they are noted as
residue, not encoded.

## 2. What the executable rule actually is

```
define PNWGmcLongELowering [
    {*ē} -> {*ǣ} || _ [EnglishStarConsonant - EnglishStarNasal],
    {*ḗ} -> {*ǣ} || _ [EnglishStarConsonant - EnglishStarNasal]
];
```

Cascade position 22. The `{*ḗ}` clause is CAPR's stressed-vowel
notation tier (acute over macron), not a separate historical change.
The rule is a **deliberate one-step telescoping** of phases (i)+(ii):
it takes *ē₁ directly to *ǣ without an intermediate *ā. The FST
comment already records why: a literal two-step implementation would
merge *ā < *ē₁ with *ā < *ai (SC004 `EAFAiMonophthongization`,
cascade position 27), and *ā < *ai was **not** fronted (OE *stān*,
*hām*). Historically the non-merger is an ordering fact — fronting of
inherited *ā "must have been well under way before the monophthongization
of *ai was complete" (R&T 2014: 169–70, endorsing Campbell 1959: §132,
pp. 52–3) — and CAPR encodes that ordering fact **architecturally**,
by symbol separation, rather than by rule order: `{*ē}` and the `{*ā}`
produced by SC004 never interact, whatever their relative positions.
This is why the first-break runner finds no executable interaction
between SC024 and SC004: the Campbell §132 constraint is real but
executable-invisible by design, and it must NOT be added to
`chronology_edges.tsv`, whose rows record runner-witnessed evidence.

## 3. Census: all 18 live firings, classified

Fresh `--evidence` census (18 of 383 rows change between the
`pnwgmc_n_stem_n_loss` and `pnwgmc_long_e_lowering` stages; the
legacy-380 subset shows the same firings).

**In-domain (13): stressed root *ē₁ before a non-nasal consonant.**
Each has the diagnostic cognate set (Gothic ē and/or ON/OS/OHG ā, OE
front vowel):

| concept | input | before → after | attested | cognate anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| adder | `*nḗdrōn` | `*nḗdrǭ → *nǣdrǭ` | nǣdre | OHG nātara, ON naðra |
| bier | `*bḗrō` | `*bḗru → *bǣru` | bǣr | OHG bāra |
| deed | `*dḗdiz` | `*dḗdi → *dǣdi` | dǣd | Goth. gadēþs, OHG tāt, OS dād |
| eel | `*ḗlaz` | `*ḗla → *ǣla` | ǣl | OHG āl, ON áll |
| hair | `*xḗrą` | `*xḗrą → *xǣrą` | hǣr | OHG hār, ON hár |
| let | `*lḗtaną` | `*lḗtaną → *lǣtaną` | lǣtan | Goth. lētan, OHG lāzan, ON láta |
| meal | `*mḗlą` | `*mḗlą → *mǣlą` | mǣl | Goth. mēl, OHG māl, ON mál |
| needle | `*nḗðlō` | `*nḗdlu → *nǣdlu` | nǣdl | Goth. nēþla, OHG nādala, ON nál |
| read | `*rḗdaną` | `*rḗdaną → *rǣdaną` | rǣdan | Goth. -rēdan, OHG rātan, ON ráða |
| sheep | `*skḗpą` | `*skḗpą → *skǣpą` | sċēap | OS skāp, OHG scāf (WGmc only) |
| sleep | `*slḗpaną` | `*slḗpaną → *slǣpaną` | slǣpan | Goth. slēpan, OHG slāfan, OS slāpan |
| weapon | `*wḗpną` | `*wḗpną → *wǣpną` | wǣpn | Goth. wēpna, OHG wāfan, ON vápn |
| year | `*jḗrą` | `*jḗrą → *jǣrą` | ġēar | Goth. jēr, OHG jār, ON ár |

Note on *sheep*: the word is West Germanic only (no Gothic or Norse
cognate); R&T 2014: 216 reconstruct PWGmc *skāp. CAPR's PGmc-shaped
input `*skḗpą` is a back-projection — a CAPR modelling convention, not
a comparative reconstruction — but the vowel's WGmc ā ~ OE/OFris front
reflexes class it securely with *ē₁.

**Implementation-proxy firings (5): unstressed non-initial *ē.**
*father* `*fádēr`, *mother* `*mōdēr`, *sister* `*swéstēr` (kinship
suffix *-ēr) and *have* `*xábēθi`, *live* `*líbēθi` (class III weak
suffix *-ē-). The attested outputs — *fæder*, *mōdor/mōder*,
*sweostor/swester*, *hæfeþ/hafaþ*, *leofaþ/lifeþ* — all show **short**
unstressed vowels, not ǣ. Historically these vowels did not take the
stressed detour at all: R&T 2014: 148 derive PGmc *fadēr > **PWGmc**
*fader* with the vowel already short, and unstressed low vowels in the
northern WGmc area merged with unstressed *ē (R&T 2014: 152–3, with
Klein 1977: 390–537 on Old Saxon). CAPR's selected inputs carry the
long unstressed vowel later than the historical languages did; SC024's
firing on them is a harmless implementation pathway whose ǣ is consumed
by the later unstressed-reduction rules, yielding the correct attested
outputs (verified in the full-cascade baseline). These five firings are
**not evidence for the historical law** and must not be cited as such.

**Absent-by-convention.** Historically central witnesses of phase (ii)
such as *wǣron*, *ġēafon*, *þǣr*, *strǣt*, *mǣġ* are absent only
because the corpus's selected citation cells do not include them; and
the preterite-plural *ē₁ cases (*bǣron*, *sǣton*) are pre-empted by
infinitive citation forms. No corpus change is warranted.

## 4. Chronology

**SC024 < SC056 (sheep, year): retained, independently demonstrated.**
The runner shows that displacing SC024 after SC056
`OEWsPalatalDiphthongization` yields *sċīep*, *ġīer* for expected
*sċēap*, *ġēar*. The historical content of this edge is genuine and not
merely stage-entailed: West Saxon palatal diphthongization operated on
the **already-fronted** vowel (ǣ > ēa after sċ-, ġ-: *sċēap*, *ġēar*,
*sċēaron*, *ġēafon*, Campbell 1959: §185, pp. 69–70; derivational chain
PWGmc *skāp > *skǣp > *sċǣp > WS sċēap, Merc./Kent. sċēp and *jǣr >
WS *ġǣr > ġēar*, R&T 2014: 216). The attested diphthong ēa itself
proves the vowel was ǣ, not ē or ā, when diphthongization applied.
One precision: the **model's** counterfactual trajectory (ē > īe by
SC056, then stranded) differs from the **historical** counterfactual
(unfronted ā would simply fail to diphthongize, yielding **sċāp*,
**ġār*), because the one-step proxy has no *ā* stage. Same conclusion,
different failure mode; the card now records this.

**Earlier side: still runner-limited; no positive lower boundary.**
The runner reaches order 13 (bundled `PWGmcChanges`) without a break.
This adjudication does not convert that limit into a boundary.
Scholarship supplies two constraints that the cascade cannot witness:
an **absolute** early anchor for phase (i) (runic *mākija*, later
2nd c. AD, Grønvik 1998: 87 apud R&T 2014: 12) and the **relative**
constraint that phase (ii) fronting preceded completion of *ai > ā
(Campbell 1959: §132; R&T 2014: 169–70) — the latter encoded
architecturally, not positionally (§2). Both live in prose, not in the
edge registry.

**Relationship to SC025.** SC024 (oral branch, > ǣ) and SC025 (nasal
branch, > ō) are the complementary conditioned outcomes of one
northern-WGmc development of low/lowered long vowels, split in CAPR at
the same cascade point (positions 22/23). Keeping them as two rules is
sound implementation practice and now carries an explicit shared
historical account; nothing in SC025's execution is changed or
adjudicated here.

## 5. Verdict

- **Historical phenomenon:** REFORMULATE. Not a single PNWGmc lowering
  to ǣ, but PNWGmc *ē₁ > *ā (pan-NWGmc, runic-dated) followed by
  Anglo-Frisian fronting of non-nasalized *ā > ǣ/ē, telescoped.
- **Conditioning/domain:** the non-nasal restriction is the genuine
  complementary condition of the fronting phase (nasal branch = SC025);
  the five unstressed firings are input-convention proxies outside the
  stressed law.
- **Historical stage:** the ǣ-producing phase is early Anglo-Frisian
  (registry `hist_stage` pnwgmc → `eaf`); the pan-NWGmc onset is
  documented in prose and in the staging notes.
- **Geographical scope:** `pan_pnwgmc` → `anglo_frisian` (OS/OHG/ON
  keep ā; WS ǣ, Anglian/Kentish/OFris ē).
- **Executable Foma rule:** RETAIN byte-for-byte, including the stable
  identifier `PNWGmcLongELowering` (not a stage claim; SC022/SC023
  convention) and the deliberate one-step proxy that keeps *ē₁ reflexes
  disjoint from *ā < *ai.
- **Executable cascade position:** RETAIN (22).
- **Chronology evidence:** RETAIN both edges; SC024 < SC056 is
  independently demonstrated (displacement witnesses sheep, year);
  earlier side remains runner-limited, no lower boundary asserted.
- **Selected-input assumptions:** citation cells pre-empt the classic
  preterite-plural witnesses; kinship/weak-III inputs carry unstressed
  long ē later than the languages did; *skḗpą* is a PGmc-shaped
  back-projection of a WGmc-only noun.
- **Fingerprints:** no FST or corpus change; expanded-383 and
  legacy-380 fingerprints expected unchanged (verified after
  propagation).

## 8. Residue

- The detour-vs-retention dispute (§1) is recorded, not resolved; the
  proxy is compatible with both. No author decision required.
- Fronting-blocking before *w and Anglian retraction are unencoded
  (no corpus row exercises them); revisit only if such rows are added.
- The five unstressed-proxy firings would disappear if the corpus ever
  switches kinship/weak-III citation forms to PWGmc-shaped inputs; the
  census test pins the current population so any such change forces
  re-adjudication.
