## 0. The question

Current SC021 is:

    define PNWGmcUnstressedORaising [
        {*o} -> {*u} || EnglishStarVocalic EnglishStarConsonant+ _ EnglishStarConsonant* {*ų}
    ];

staged as a Proto-Northwest Germanic change (cascade position 20), justified
in the inventory by Fulk §7.31 (an-stem acc. sg. *-onų > *-unų), and firing on
0 of the current corpus rows. The question, per the final-z programme, is
whether this rule corresponds to a real, securely established historical
process — or whether it conflates or misstates distinct developments.

Candidate analyses kept separate throughout:

- **A.** A genuine (N)WGmc change of unstressed short *o > *u before *u in
  the next syllable (the rule as implemented).
- **B.** Traditional van Helten raising of unstressed long *ō > *ū before *u
  in the next syllable (van Helten 1891: 460, 463–464).
- **C.** Stausland Johnsen's development: PWGmc unstressed *ō > pre-OE *o by
  regular shortening, then > u in unstressed MEDIAL syllables vs. a in final
  syllables (Stausland Johnsen 2015: 28–31).
- **D.** Some combination of distinct processes.
- **E.** No secure sound law corresponding to current SC021.

## 1. What exactly is traditional van Helten's law?

Van Helten (1891: 460, 463–464, as reported by Stausland Johnsen 2015: 22)
proposed that PWGmc unstressed *ō was raised to *ū by assimilation to a *u in
the following syllable: 3 pl. pret. *wundōdun > *wundūdun > OE wundudun,
against 3 sg. *wundōdē > wundade. It is a **Proto-West-Germanic** rule whose
conditioning syllable is often lost in OE (perf. f. nom. sg. *wundōdu >
*wundūdu > wundud vs. m. *wundōdaz > wundad; Stausland Johnsen 2015: 22–23).
Its input is **long *ō**.

The broadest handbook statement folds a short-vowel twin into the same
paragraph: Campbell §331.6 (pp. 139–140) has, in North and West Germanic
medial unaccented syllables, IE *o > u and Gmc *ō > ū "when m followed, or
when u stood in the following syllable", citing dat. pl. *-omiz > -um, masc.
weak acc. *ʒumunu(z), fem. weak acc. *tungūnu (cf. Northumbrian foldu),
*-ōþuz > OE fiscoþ, superlative -ust- before u, and class II weak past
-ōdō ~ -udun "either vowel might be generalized, hence OE -ode beside -ade".
Bülbring likewise derives Northumbrian galgu < *ʒalʒonu by u-umlaut of the
short thematic vowel (§366, p. 148, citing van Helten PBB XV 460ff.) and
foldu/eorðu < *-ōnu < *-ōnum (§391, p. 157). Stausland Johnsen (2015: 23)
documents near-universal acceptance: Brunner 1965: 31–32, 128, 329; Bülbring
1902: 156–157; Campbell 1959: 139; Girvan 1931: 126; Hogg 1992: 66–67;
Hogg & Fulk 2011: 283; Kieckers 1935: 36–37; Luick 1921: 269–270.

## 2. What exactly is current CAPR SC021, and is it the same rule?

No. Current SC021 implements only the **short-vowel half** of Campbell
§331.6, restricted to the pre-*ų environment, and stages it as
Proto-Northwest Germanic. Its cited warrant is Fulk §7.31 (p. 170): in the
an-stem acc. sg., PIE *-on-m̥ > *-on-um, "in which *-on- should have yielded,
in (N)WGmc., *-un- before *u in the next syllable", with early Northumbrian
galgu < *ʒalʒun < WGmc *ʒalʒunum as the OE relic. Fulk's fuller statement is
§5.5 (pp. 88–89): PIE *o is "usually thought" to have remained rounded in
certain unstressed positions, becoming NWGmc u before m (dat. pl. -um, 1 pl.
-um); and "a similar development is **commonly said** to affect both this
same o and also ō, which developed to u and ū, before u in the next
syllable" — with examples *-on-um > -un (OS gumon/-un, OHG gomon/-un,
Northumbrian galgu) and *-ōn-um > -un (OHG zungūn, Northumbrian foldu,
eorðu).

Van Helten's law proper (input *ō) and the short-*o raising SC021 implements
are therefore **distinct claims** bundled by the tradition; Fulk's own
footnotes keep them separable and flag both as contested (§5.5 nn. 5–6):
Boutkan calls the raising "van Helten's law"; "the idea is rejected in Ringe
& Taylor 2014: 62–5"; and Walde (1900: 169) explains the Northumbrian masc.
-u as analogical to the feminine forms with ū < ō. Fulk also concedes "the ON
evidence for these latter changes is almost all capable of alternative
explanation" (§5.5, p. 89).

## 3. What does Ringe & Taylor accept or reject, and why?

R&T 2014 reject any general (P)NWGmc raising here (pp. 62–65):

1. "There cannot have been any general change of *-on- to *-un- in the
   PNWGmc period", because OS/OHG gen. pl. -ōno (and dat. pl. -ōm) preserve
   the non-raised vowel, and the suffixal syllable is still written -on- in
   early Early Runic (Krause 1971: 119) (p. 63).
2. The narrower "*-ōnu- > *-ūnu- by regular sound change ... does make
   phonetic sense; but" only the acc. sg. and acc. pl. had *u in the ending,
   and the acc. pl. merged with the nom. pl. very early — "too small a basis"
   for the observed paradigm-wide u-vocalism (p. 63).
3. Their preferred alternative: after loss of word-final high vowels, new
   word-final *-ōn became *-un in the **more southerly WGmc dialects**,
   covering exactly the OS/OHG cells with -un (p. 63).
4. galgu "is not necessarily relevant; we must reckon with the possibility
   that its -u is connected with the usual OHG masc. acc. sg. ending
   -un ~ -on (Bammesberger 1990: 169)" (p. 63 n.).
5. On the n-stem relics generally: after weighing three scenarios for
   Northumbrian galgu/foldu/eorðu, "I know of no proposal that solves all
   the problems convincingly" (p. 164).
6. In R&T's framework the an-stem acc. sg. is *-anų in any case (PIE *o >
   PGmc *a in unstressed syllables too), so hypothesis A has no input to
   operate on unless Fulk's contested o-retention is also accepted.

## 4. What does Fulk mean by the *-onų > *-unų material?

Fulk §7.31 (p. 170) uses the raising to explain why OS/OHG show acc. sg.
-on/-un where Gothic shows -an: PIE *-on-m̥ > *-onum with branch-specific
vocalism (EGmc *-an-, (N)WGmc *-un- before *u, per §5.5). OE -an in the acc.
must then be analogical, with galgu the sole relic of *-un-. This presupposes
Fulk's §5.5 position that unstressed PIE *o was not fully merged with *a in
PGmc — a position he himself presents as "usually thought"/"commonly said"
and flags as rejected by R&T. It is a coherent account inside Fulk's
framework, not an independently secure sound law.

## 5. What exactly does Stausland Johnsen demonstrate?

Stausland Johnsen 2015, on all 457 past-tense ō-verb forms of the Hatton 20
manuscript of King Alfred's Pastoral Care (c. 890, the largest early-OE
text):

1. **Van Helten's rule fails statistically**: u is not more common where *u
   originally followed — the trend is actually opposite; a logistic
   regression with van Helten's predictor explains R² = 0.019 of the
   variation and is not significant (χ²(1) = 1.007, p = 0.316). "This rule
   should as a result be rejected" (pp. 24–25).
2. **His replacement**: unstressed long vowels shorten regularly in pre-OE;
   the shortened *o (< *ō) raises to u in unstressed **medial** syllables
   (where unstressed vowels are phonetically shortest) and lowers to a in
   **final** syllables: *wundōdē > *wundŏde > wundude vs. *wundōdu >
   *wundod > wundad — the exact opposite cells from van Helten (pp. 28–29).
   Model fit R² = 0.827, χ²(1) = 25.41, p < 0.000001 (p. 31).
3. **Chronology**: the split necessarily follows the loss of short unstressed
   vowels and the shortening of long unstressed vowels (the *bursti-/*burstīz
   argument, pp. 29–30). It is therefore a **late pre-OE / OE** development,
   statable synchronically: PWGmc *ō > OE u in medial, a in final syllables
   (p. 30). It is NOT a PWGmc, let alone a PNWGmc, rule.
4. **Scope limits he states himself** (§7, p. 36): demonstrated only for the
   ō-verbs and only for West Saxon; extension to other morphological classes
   and other dialects "would be of great value to demonstrate" but remains
   further research. His input is specifically original long *ō; the paper
   licenses no conclusion about inherited short *o.

## 6. What remains untested in his account?

Non-verb morphology (nouns like foldu/eorðu), non-West-Saxon dialects
(exactly where the n-stem relics live), and any interaction with inherited
short *o (which in Ringe's framework does not exist unstressed, and in
Fulk's framework is confined to specific environments). Using the
Northumbrian relics as evidence FOR Stausland Johnsen's rule would be
precisely the extension he flags as undemonstrated — and in the acc. sg.
cell his rule, naively extended, predicts **folda (final syllable > a), not
foldu.

## 7. The four lexical witnesses

### galgu 'gallows, cross'

- Attested: Ruthwell Cross 40, early Northumbrian, masc. acc. sg. (Campbell
  §617, p. 249; R&T p. 62).
- Etymon: PGmc *galgan- m. (Kroonen 2013: 165 s.v. *galgan-); the root vowel
  is *a; the diagnostic vowel is the **suffix** vowel of the acc. sg.
- Preform: Fulk WGmc *ʒalʒunum with raised *-un- (§7.31, p. 170); Ringe
  *ʒalʒanų with *a (R&T pp. 62–63); Bülbring *ʒalʒonu (§366, p. 148).
- The vowel is **not *ō** on any account: Stausland Johnsen's shortening
  analysis cannot derive it, and using it for his rule would be a category
  error, not merely an extension.
- Serious analogical alternatives are on the table: Bammesberger 1990: 169
  derives the secondary *-un-u ending from the dative plural ("*-un- muß
  sekundär in den Akk. Sg. eingeführt worden sein"); Walde 1900: 169 takes
  the masc. -u as analogical to the feminines; R&T endorse the doubt
  (p. 63 n., p. 164).
- Verdict: **analogically ambiguous; not secure sound-law evidence.** The
  prior corpus-maturation adjudication (corpus-maturation-01 §4) declining
  GALLOWS stands.

### foldu, eorðu 'earth'

- Attested: foldu Cædmon's Hymn 9 (M), eorðu Leiden Riddle 11; early
  Northumbrian, fem. acc. sg. (Campbell §617, p. 249; R&T pp. 62, 164).
- Etymon: fem. ōn-stems *foldōn-, *erþōn-; acc. sg. *-ōn-um — the diagnostic
  vowel IS original long *ō.
- Traditional account: *-ōnu > *-ūnu > -u (Bülbring §391, p. 157; Campbell
  §§331.6, 617) = van Helten's law — whose conditioning is now statistically
  rejected in the only corpus where it was directly testable.
- R&T: possibly the southerly word-final *-ōn > *-un change with northern
  participation, possibly not; three scenarios weighed, "no proposal ...
  convincing[]" (p. 164).
- Stausland Johnsen: could only derive them by an extension (non-verb,
  non-WS) that he explicitly leaves untested, and his final-syllable
  prediction for this cell is a, not u (§5.1, pp. 28–30).
- Verdict: **genuinely disputed diagnostics with no consensus derivation.**

### zungūn (OHG)

- OHG oblique sg. of zunga 'tongue' < fem. ōn-stem *tungōn-; the obliques
  show -ūn with long ū (R&T p. 62 table; Fulk §5.5, p. 89).
- What it establishes: a **continental WGmc** development of *-ōn(-) with
  raised vocalism. R&T derive it from new word-final *-ōn > *-un in the
  southerly dialects after ending loss, which explains why -ūn appears in
  gen./dat. sg. (original *-i endings, no *u ever followed) as well as the
  acc. (p. 63); van Helten's before-*u conditioning covers only the acc. and
  requires levelling for the rest.
- It is comparative evidence about OS/OHG paradigm history, **not evidence
  for an Old English or NWGmc rule**, and it is not corpus material.

## 8. What relative chronology is independently supported?

- Whatever produced OS/OHG -un/-ūn cannot be PNWGmc-general: OS/OHG gen. pl.
  -ōno and early Runic -on- exclude it (R&T p. 63).
- Stausland Johnsen's medial-syllable raising is fixed AFTER loss of short
  unstressed vowels and shortening of long unstressed vowels — late pre-OE
  (2015: 29–30). Current SC021's PNWGmc staging (cascade position 20) is
  incompatible with both findings.

## 9. Verdict

**RETIRE SC021 AS FORMULATED, AND IMPLEMENT THE EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED
SUCCESSOR (Stausland Johnsen's law) IN THE UNSTRESSED-*ō CHAIN, WITH A NEW
CORPUS WITNESS SO THE CORRECTED RULE FIRES.**

In the directive's terms this is SPLIT/REFORMULATE, not a bare retirement:
the one secure sound law in SC021's evidential neighbourhood (hypothesis C)
is real, currently mis-modelled by the cascade, and must be implemented and
witnessed — following the SC020 final-z precedent of decomposing a
traditional rule into the changes the evidence actually supports.

Diagnosis of SC021 itself: current SC021 is hypothesis A, and hypothesis A
is not a securely established sound law.

1. **Mis-staged**: its PNWGmc stage claim is directly contradicted by the
   Runic and OS/OHG gen. pl. evidence (R&T p. 63); even its supporters state
   it as "commonly said" while citing the rejection (Fulk §5.5 & n. 5).
2. **Contested input**: it presupposes unstressed short *o surviving into
   NWGmc, which R&T's framework denies outright and Fulk hedges (§5.5 n. 3).
3. **Witnesses fail**: the sole OE relic (galgu) has live analogical
   explanations endorsed by R&T and Bammesberger; the fem. relics involve
   *ō, not *o; the continental forms are better covered by R&T's word-final
   *-ōn > *-un account. "I know of no proposal that solves all the problems
   convincingly" (R&T p. 164).
4. **The neighbouring law changed underneath it**: the traditional van
   Helten conditioning (before-*u) that motivated the whole raising complex
   is statistically refuted for the one dataset where it is directly
   testable (Stausland Johnsen 2015: 24–25), and the empirically supported
   replacement is a different change (input *ō, medial-syllable conditioning,
   late pre-OE stage) that current SC021 does not represent.
5. **Unwitnessed**: SC021 fires on 0 of the corpus rows; retirement is
   output-neutral for every derivation. Retaining it would keep an
   affirmative, disputed historical claim in the executable cascade for no
   derivational benefit — exactly what the chronology programme exists to
   eliminate.

This is a decidable verdict, not "evidence insufficient": no corpus
derivation depends on retaining hypothesis A, and every leg the old rule
stood on (stage, input, witnesses, and the parent conditioning) is either
refuted or analogically ambiguous in the current literature — while
hypothesis C carries direct statistical demonstration.

## 9a. The real change the cascade must model

The cascade currently compresses the history of unstressed *ō into a single
blanket rule, SC071 `OELateOShortening`: *ō > *a in all non-initial
syllables (after fronting, per Campbell §355). All six current firings
(mōnaþ and the weak II 3sg presents *-ōþi > -aþ after i-apocope) happen to
be **final-syllable** cases, so the compression is extensionally correct
today — but it hard-codes van Helten's loser: any medial-syllable *ō
(*wundōdē type) would surface as **wundade, which is exactly the outcome
Stausland Johnsen's data refute (2015: 24–25, 28–31).

The historically supported chain (Stausland Johnsen 2015: 28–31; chronology
(8) pp. 29–30) is:

1. **Shortening**: unstressed *ō > *o, AFTER the loss of short unstressed
   vowels (the *bursti-/*burstīz argument) and after fronting (Campbell
   §355: the late product does not become æ). SC071 is reformulated to
   produce *o instead of jumping to *a.
2. **Medial raising** (NEW rule, new SC ID): the shortened *o raises to *u
   in unstressed MEDIAL syllables (*wundŏde > wundude). This is the secure,
   statistically demonstrated law (R² = 0.827, p < 0.000001). Domain note:
   demonstrated for WS ō-verb pasts; the corpus witness stays inside that
   domain.
3. **Final lowering** (NEW rule, new SC ID): the shortened *o in FINAL
   syllables undergoes the general development to a (*wundod > wundad;
   mōnaþ; -aþ). This is the "general development of pre-OE *o to a" that
   the tradition and Stausland Johnsen agree on.

Relative chronology encoded: fronting < shortening < medial raising; the
raising must precede the 9th-c. lowering tendency u > o (SC040), because
the raising's output u is what the earliest (8th-c.) texts write
(Stausland Johnsen 2015: 21–22). Campbell §373's vowel-harmony clause
(u preserved after accented u) keeps wundude's medial u intact under SC040,
so the wund- witness is stable under both.

**As implemented** (germanic.txt; mirrored in old_english_sandbox.txt and
the trace-stage table): SC071 `OELateOShortening` now reads *ō > *o; the
medial raising is `OEMedUnstressedORaising` (SC099) and the final lowering
`OEFinalUnstressedOLowering` (SC100), composed immediately after SC071 in
both composition sites. The shortened *o is a plain short *o — deliberately
NOT a special segment: pre-OE has no other source of unstressed *o (the
earliest texts have only u and a as unstressed back vowels, Stausland
Johnsen 2015: 21; classical-OE unstressed o is created only by SC040's
9th-c. lowering), so the correct chronology alone guarantees that SC099/
SC100 see exactly the vowels they should. Making that true required
executing the SC040 repair below rather than working around it.

The project's formal interaction machinery (`cascade_interaction_harness.py`,
equivalence over the whole admitted input language) confirms the wiring:
SC071→SC099 and SC071→SC100 are feeding (noncommute); SC099×SC100 commute
(disjoint medial/final domains); SC099→SC040 and SC100→SC040 are both
load-bearing (noncommute) — the computational image of the 8th-c. vs 9th-c.
stage contrast. Fronting × SC071 now commutes formally (the old noncommute
came solely from the *ō > *a compression feeding fronting's domain); SC071's
late placement rests on Stausland Johnsen's chronology (8), pp. 29–30, and
Campbell §355.

**Defect exposed and repaired (Phase-4)**: SC040 `OEMedUnstressedULowering`
— a late (9th-c.) OE change (Campbell §373) — previously executed at
cascade position 40, BEFORE Anglo-Frisian brightening and the pre-OE
shortening block (~46–70). That executable order was already historically
inverted before this adjudication, and under the corrected split it became
untenable: with SC040 early, its output o (heofon) would be swept by SC100
to **heofan. SC040 is therefore moved to after the c.700 unstressed
mergers (OEUnstressedAEMerger / OEMedUnstressedILowering), matching its
9th-c. date, at both composition sites and in the sandbox. The move is
validated two ways: the full 382-row expanded corpus is byte-identical
(outputs_sha256 edf552a3…, legacy subset a72bdeb8… unchanged), and the
interaction harness classifies each of the 27 rules SC040 jumped over
(order_tests/sc021_repair_interaction_matrix.tsv). Five pairs are formally
load-bearing — OEWLossBeforeI, OEIUmlaut, OEMedialSyncope,
OELAdjacentSyncope, OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening, each vs SC040 — and in
every one of them the NEW order puts the historically earlier (pre-OE or
c.700) change before the 9th-c. lowering. That is, SC040's old position was
not just inverted against the ō block: it was formally load-bearing and
historically inverted against i-umlaut, the syncopes, pre-OE w-loss, and
unstressed long-vowel shortening as well; no current corpus row happened to
distinguish those orders, which is why the defect was invisible to outputs.

**Corpus witness**: OE wundude 'wounded (3 sg. pret. ind. of wundian)',
PWGmc *wundōdē — Stausland Johnsen's own Paradebeispiel (6a), from the
wund- paradigm whose a ~ u variation (wundad ~ wundud, 2015: 20 (2b)) is
Hatton 20 data; the medial-syllable cells of his 457-form corpus show u as
the regular outcome. mōnaþ (already in the corpus) serves as the
final-syllable positive control, and the weak II presents in -aþ as
further final-syllable controls. This follows the corpus-maturation tack
used for WHO/YOU: the corrected rule must actually fire on a witnessed row.

**Phase-4 final state**: the SC040 `OEMedUnstressedULowering` defect reported
above is repaired, not residual. The late (9th-c.) OE lowering (Campbell §373)
now executes after the c.700 unstressed mergers and the SC071 → SC099 → SC100
chain, at both production composition sites and in the sandbox. This is the
historically ordered final architecture: the short *o produced by SC071 is
first resolved as medial *u or final *a, and SC040 can then apply only at its
own later OE stage. No further SC040 staging question remains in this SC021
adjudication.

**Re-entry conditions** (recorded so the SC021 retirement is not silent
loss):

- The medial-raising successor implemented per §9a is deliberately scoped
  to what Stausland Johnsen demonstrates (shortened *o < *ō). If future
  corpus evidence ever requires raising of other unstressed vowels, that is
  a new adjudication, not a widening of this rule.
- If a Northumbrian n-stem relic (galgu/foldu/eorðu) is ever proposed as a
  corpus row, an author decision is required first, because the literature
  offers no consensus derivation for the -u (van Helten raising rejected;
  R&T's word-final account dialect-restricted and hedged; analogy live).

## 10. Corpus-witness decisions (separate from the rule verdict)

- **wundude** (3 sg. pret. of wundian): ADDED as the witness for the new
  medial-raising rule — inside Stausland Johnsen's demonstrated domain
  (WS ō-verb past, Hatton 20 wund- paradigm). Paradigm-cell target,
  following the fundene/speoru precedent.
- **galgu**: remains declined (analogically ambiguous; corpus-maturation-01
  §4 upheld with the added R&T/Bammesberger grounds above).
- **foldu, eorðu**: declined for now — no consensus preform-to-surface
  derivation exists to implement; adding them would force an arbitrary
  choice among rejected or hedged analyses.
- **zungūn**: comparative evidence only; never a corpus row (OHG).
