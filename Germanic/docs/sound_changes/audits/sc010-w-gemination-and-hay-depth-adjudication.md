# SC010 *w-gemination and the reconstruction depth of *hay*

Bounded repair memo. Follow-up to
`audits/sc029-sc030-awj-resolution-and-au-fronting-adjudication.md`
(commit 7dcc70fa..11aa99e8). Scope: the West Germanic gemination of `*w`
before `*j`, and the Proto-Germanic form selected for *hay*. This memo does
not re-adjudicate SC010 as a whole, and does not touch SC031-SC034.

Status: repair adopted, architecture A.

## 1. The inconsistency this memo resolves

Commit 11aa99e8 identified SC029 as the **reversal of the West Germanic
gemination of `*w` before `*j`**. That left CAPR internally inconsistent in
three ways:

1. SC010 `PWGmcJGemination` geminated thirteen consonants before `*j` but
   excluded `*w`, so the model contained no rule producing the geminate
   SC029 was said to reverse.
2. *hay* was fed as `*xáwwją`, a form carrying a West Germanic geminate in a
   Proto-Germanic slot.
3. *strew* was fed as `*stráwjaną`, correctly Proto-Germanic with singleton
   `*w`.

The two witnesses of a single change therefore entered the cascade at two
different reconstruction depths, and SC029 carried both a geminate and a
singleton branch to accommodate them. The prose adopted the
Ringe-Taylor/Campbell account while the executable model adopted Fulk's,
except for one lexically pre-geminated form.

## 2. The two architectures

**A. Ringe-Taylor/Campbell.** PGmc singleton `*wj` geminates to `*wwj` by the
ordinary West Germanic gemination law; pre-OE then resolves `*awwj` to
`*auj`.

**B. Fulk.** `*w` never geminated before `*j`. The element was vocalic from
the start, so there is no `*wwj` stage and no later reversal, and SC029 would
not exist as a discrete change.

## 3. What the direct sources say

### 3.1 *w participates in the ordinary gemination law

Campbell §407 p. 167 states the law and its single exception:

> W. Gmc. consonant doubling is particularly strongly developed before j,
> every consonant except r being affected after short syllables. ... The
> forms in which w is doubled are dealt with in §120.2.

That is explicit: `*w` is an ordinary member of the same change, and its
particular outcomes are merely cross-referenced to the diphthong section
rather than split off as a separate law. Campbell §120.2 p. 46 gives the
sequence directly: "auj > auuj > auj", with "Prim. Gmc. *hawja- > West Gmc.
*hauu- > OE hēg, hīg, hay", and lists *strēgan* 'strew' among the same set.

Ringe & Taylor p. 53 reach the same conclusion independently:

> The eventual development of *wj in OE was complex (see Brunner 1965: 142),
> but it appears that that cluster too underwent gemination in PWGmc.

They call this "obvious when the preceding vowel was *i", citing PGmc
`*niwjaz` > PWGmc `*[niw'w'a-]`, `*siwjaną` > `*[siww'ian]`, and `*gliwjas` >
`*[gliwwias]`. Only after establishing gemination for `*iwj` do they turn to
`*awj`, where "the usual OE outcome seems to reflect not *aw'w' but *auj",
and conclude:

> But because gemination was not a merger, it involved no loss of contrasts,
> and did not alter underlying forms, it was reversible: a sequence of changes
> PNWGmc *awj > PWGmc *[aw'w'] > pre-OE *[auj] can have occurred, and I
> suggest that that is exactly what happened.

They add that this is "in principle the same as that of Campbell 1962: 46".

Two independent handbooks therefore place `*w` inside the gemination law and
derive the pre-OE diphthong by resolving its output. R&T p. 52 confirm that
the law's genuine exceptions are `*r` and `*z` only, both plausibly for a
shared phonetic reason, probably retroflexion.

### 3.2 Fulk's dissent, stated precisely

Fulk §4.10 p. 73 reports the handbook account and then rejects it. His note 1
p. 73 is the substance:

> It is difficult to imagine how w could have remained consonantal in forms
> like *strawjaną and *niwjaz (cf. Go. stráujan, niujis), and at all events
> WGmc. *strauwjan should be expected to have developed not to EWS *strīegan
> but to *strīewjan > *strīewan. ... Rather, EWS *strīegan may be derived
> unproblematically from PGmc. *straujaną.

Fulk's alternative is not that `*awj` continued unchanged without gemination.
It is that the diphthong is **original**: Proto-Germanic already had
`*straujaną`, not `*strawjaną`. His argument is partly evidential (Gothic
`stráujan`, `niujis`) and partly a derivational objection about the expected
West Saxon outcome.

### 3.3 Adjudication

CAPR adopts **architecture A**, for four reasons.

1. It is the account CAPR already adopted for SC029 in 11aa99e8, on R&T p. 53
   read directly. Adopting B would require retracting that identification.
2. Two handbooks reach it independently, and Campbell §407 makes `*w` an
   ordinary member of a law whose exceptions are otherwise narrowly and
   phonetically motivated.
3. R&T's `*iwj` evidence is independent of the disputed `*awj` cases.
   `*niwjaz` > OS, OHG `niuwi` shows the geminate outside English.
4. The continental comparanda are only explicable on A: OHG `houwi` and
   `gistrouwen` and OS `hoi` retain exactly the geminate that A reconstructs
   and B denies ever existed. Campbell §120.2 and R&T p. 53 both make this
   point.

Fulk's objection is recorded but not adopted. Its force is real, and it is
why SC029 keeps confidence B and why the `*w` branch of SC010 is flagged
below as the law's one disputed member.

## 4. Corrected input for *hay*

No source reconstructs a Proto-Germanic geminate here. The handbooks divide
only over whether the second element was consonantal or vocalic:

| Source | Reconstruction | Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ringe & Taylor p. 53 | PGmc `*hawja` | A |
| Campbell §120.2 p. 46 | Prim. Gmc. `*hawja-` | A |
| Kroonen p. 215 | PGmc `*hauja-` | B |

CAPR's former `*xáwwją` was therefore supported by **neither** camp. Under the
adopted architecture the correct input is the singleton form, in CAPR
notation `*xáwją`: `*x` for PGmc `*h`, acute for stress, and the neuter
ja-stem nominative-accusative singular ending `-ją` retained unchanged from
the previous entry. The ending is not at issue here and was not altered.

The governing invariant: **a selected Proto-Germanic input must not
pre-encode a West Germanic change that the cascade itself models.**

*strew*'s existing `*stráwjaną` was already correct and is unchanged.

## 5. The `*w` branch of SC010

Added to `PWGmcJGemination`:

```foma
{*w} -> {*w} {*w} || EnglishStarShortVowel _ {*j}
```

This is the same environment, short vowel before, `*j` after, as the other
thirteen members. It is not a *hay*-specific exception.

### 5.1 Census of the branch across the whole selected corpus

Every selected protoform containing `w` was examined. Exactly three place a
`*w` immediately before a `*j`, and all three have a short stressed vowel:

| Protoform | `*w` immediately before `*j`? | Short vowel before `*w`? | Fires | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `*xáwją` (hay) | yes | yes, `*á` | **yes** | correct, Campbell §120.2 p. 46, R&T p. 53 |
| `*stráwjaną` (strew) | yes | yes, `*á` | **yes** | correct, Campbell §120.2 p. 46, R&T p. 53 |
| `*xéwją` (hue) | yes | yes, `*é` | **yes** | correct, Campbell §120.2 p. 46, R&T p. 53; see §5.2 |
| `*knéwą` (knee) | no, no `*j` at all | yes, `*é` | no | structural non-member, minimal pair with *hue* |
| `*lḗwijaną` (betray) | no, `*wi` | no, long `*ḗ` | no | structural non-member, two grounds |
| `*smérwijaną` (smear) | no, `*wi` | yes | no | structural non-member |
| `*skáwōjaną` (show) | no, `*wō` | yes | no | structural non-member |
| `*wéljaną`, `*wéljô` (will) | no, `*lj` | no, word-initial `w` | no | structural non-member |
| `*kéwwaną`, `*xáwwaną`, `*dáwwō` | no `*j` | yes | no | Proto-Germanic geminate by Verschärfung |
| `*snáiwaz`, `*sáiwiz` | no `*j` | no, diphthong | no | structural non-member |

The branch affects exactly **three cognate sets**, all of which the handbooks
place squarely in its domain. Machine verification of the rule in isolation:

```
*x*á*w*j*ą          -> *x*á*w*w*j*ą
*x*é*w*j*ą          -> *x*é*w*w*j*ą
*s*t*r*á*w*j*a*n*ą  -> *s*t*r*á*w*w*j*a*n*ą
*k*n*é*w*ą          -> unchanged
*l*ḗ*w*i*j*a*n*ą    -> unchanged
*s*m*é*r*w*i*j*a*n*ą -> unchanged
*s*k*á*w*ō*j*a*n*ą  -> unchanged
```

The negative forms above are engineering near-misses and are labelled as such
in the regression suite. They are **not** independent demonstrations of the
short-syllable conditioning: in each the `*w` simply is not before a `*j`.

That conditioning cannot in fact be demonstrated directly with a `*wj`
minimal pair, and the reason is Sievers' law. After a heavy syllable the
suffix surfaces with the `*-ij-` allomorph, which is precisely why *betray*
is `*lḗwijaną` and *smear* is `*smérwijaną` rather than `**lḗwjaną` and
`**smérwjaną`. A clean long-syllable `*wj` reconstruction therefore does not
exist to be used as a control, in this corpus or in Proto-Germanic. The
regression suite records this by requiring every selected `*wj` form to have a
short vowel, so that a source-supported long-syllable `*wj` form, should one
ever be found, surfaces immediately as the missing control.

### 5.2 The `*iwj` continuation, and why it is a control rather than a hazard

The earlier statement of this section treated an `*iwj` lexeme as a hazard,
on the grounds that SC010 would create a geminate which SC029, whose context
requires a preceding `*a`, could not resolve. That was wrong about the
history, and the corpus is now corrected.

Campbell states the two types together and then separates their outcomes
(§120.2 p. 46):

> A similar development took place when *u* was doubled before *j* by the West
> Gmc. gemination of consonants (see §407): *auj* > *auuj* > *auj*, and *iuj* >
> *iuuj* > *iuj*. ... Generally, the *u* of *auuj* is lost, so that the final
> result is *ēġ* or *ieġ*, but the *j* of *iuuj* is lost, so that the result is
> *īow* or *īew*.

So gemination is shared; what differs is which of the two glides survives the
later resolution. Ringe and Taylor supply the comparative warrant for the
front-vowel half independently of the disputed `*awj` cases, reconstructing
PWGmc `*[niwwa-]`, `*[siwwian]` and `*[gliwwias]` (p. 53). An `*iwj` lexeme is
therefore not an unmodelled hazard; it is exactly the witness the branch was
missing, because before it every witness of the gemination also underwent the
`*awwj` resolution.

The corpus now carries one. The selected input is *hue*, PGmc `*xéwją`, from
Kroonen's `*heuja-` n. 'visible layer, appearance' (p. 224, s.v.; Go. *hiwi*,
ON *hý*, OE *hīw*, *hēow*, ME *hue*); the prevocalic `*-u-` is written `*w`
as in *knee* `*knéwą` and *chew* `*kéwwaną`, and the raising of `*e` to `*i`
before `*j` is left to the cascade, so `*xíwją` reaches the same output. The
counterpart is Campbell's West Saxon *hīew*, which he prints beside *hīow* in
this very section; his rule is that the resulting *iu-* "appears as *io-* in
nW-S, *ie-* in W-S", and CAPR targets West Saxon throughout.

No new rule and no new branch was required. The existing machinery already
models the continuation: the geminate is simplified by SC031
`OEWWSimplification`, and the `*j` is lost after the now heavy syllable. The
derivation is in §8.

Two other members of Campbell's list were considered and rejected. His
headline example, *nīowe*, *nīewe* 'new', cannot be targeted because the
cascade does not model the inflectional `*-e` of *ja*-stem adjectives: it
yields *grēn* for *grēne* and *mild* for *milde*, so 'new' would have failed
for reasons wholly unrelated to gemination. That gap is recorded in §11 as
separate debt. Campbell's *glīow*, *glīw* 'mirth' is a genuine member of the
type, but he prints no West Saxon *glīew*.

### 5.2.1 The paradigm contrast, recorded but not entered in the corpus

Ringe and Taylor's own argument for the gemination rests on a contrast
*within* paradigms: cells whose ending contained `*j` geminate, cells whose
ending contained `*i` do not. They cite OHG *hewi* beside *houwi* for this
very lexeme, and, inside Old English itself, *glīg* from the non-geminated
nominative beside *glīowes* in the geminated genitive (p. 53).

That is strong comparative warrant, and it is cited in the reader-facing
chapter. It is deliberately **not** entered in the corpus: representing it
would require two selected protoforms for a single lexical derivation, which
the project's conventions do not permit. The corpus tests the claim instead
through the *hay* : *hue* minimal pair, where the inputs differ in one
segment, both geminate, and only then diverge.

### 5.3 Not a separate historical identity

Per Campbell §407 the `*w` cases are the same law, so no new SC was created.
SC010 keeps `fst_identifier` `PWGmcJGemination`, stage `pwgmc`, scope
`pan_wgmc`, and **confidence A**. The general law is not weakened by the
dispute over one of its members; the dispute is recorded in `staging_notes`
and in the rule's header comment, not in the confidence letter. SC010 remains
`unadjudicated`, as it was before this repair.

## 6. Consequences for SC029

With both witnesses now reaching SC029 as `*áwwj`, the singleton branches
were unwitnessed. They were an artifact of *hay*'s pre-geminated protoform,
not a historical claim. Removed:

```foma
{*á} {*w} {*j} -> {*áu} {*j},
{*a} {*w} {*j} -> {*au} {*j}
```

Retained:

```foma
{*á} {*w} {*w} {*j} -> {*áu} {*j},
{*a} {*w} {*w} {*j} -> {*au} {*j}
```

The surviving pair are CAPR notation variants for marked and unmarked stress,
not a historical stress condition; the change is not stress-conditioned in any
source. SC029's domain is now exactly what architecture A predicts: geminate
in, diphthong out.

SC029 keeps **confidence B**. Its discreteness depends on accepting the
disputed gemination analysis, which Luick himself called "wahrscheinlich aber
nicht strikte zu erweisen". The repair makes CAPR consistent with that
analysis; it does not make the analysis certain.

## 7. SC010 feeds SC029

SC010 now creates the `*wwj` that SC029 consumes, so the feeding relation is
recorded in `chronology_edges.tsv`. The warrant is scholarly, not merely
executable: R&T p. 53 state the sequence as a sequence, PNWGmc `*awj` > PWGmc
`*[aw'w']` > pre-OE `*[auj]`, and Campbell §120.2 writes it as the ordered
chain "auj > auuj > auj". Both handbooks present gemination and its reversal
as successive stages of one history, with the geminate as a reconstructed
intermediate rather than a notational convenience.

SC010 and SC029 are **not** telescoped into one rule. The intermediate is
reconstructed by the sources, is directly attested in the continental
cognates (OHG `houwi`, `gistrouwen`, OS `hoi`), and the later reversal is no
reason to delete the earlier change from the model.

*hay* and *strew* are the witnesses for the sequence.

## 8. Derivations after the repair

Both now pass through the reconstructed West Germanic geminate and reach
unchanged surfaces.

*hay*, PGmc `*xáwją`, expected `hīeġ`, output `hīeġ`:

```
EnglishProtoInput:        *x*á*w*j*ą
PWGmcJGemination:         *x*á*w*w*j*ą      <- SC010, newly firing
OEAwjGlideFormation:      *x*áu*j*ą         <- SC029
OEAuFronting:             *x*áeu*j*ą        <- SC030
OEDiphthongLeveling:      *x*ēa*j*ą         <- SC032
OEVelarFricativePalatalization: *ç*ēa*j*ą
OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope:    *ç*ēa*j
OEIUmlaut:                *ç*īe*j
OldEnglishOrthography:    h*īeġ
```

*strew*, PGmc `*stráwjaną`, expected `strīeġan`, output `strīeġan`:

```
EnglishProtoInput:        *s*t*r*á*w*j*a*n*ą
PWGmcJGemination:         *s*t*r*á*w*w*j*a*n*ą   <- SC010, newly firing
OEAwjGlideFormation:      *s*t*r*áu*j*a*n*ą      <- SC029
OEAuFronting:             *s*t*r*áeu*j*a*n*ą     <- SC030
OEDiphthongLeveling:      *s*t*r*ēa*j*a*n*ą      <- SC032
```

These reproduce R&T p. 53 and Campbell §120.2 step for step.

*hue*, PGmc `*xéwją`, expected `hīew`, output `hīew`:

```
EnglishProtoInput:        *x*é*w*j*ą
PWGmcJGemination:         *x*é*w*w*j*ą      <- SC010, the shared gemination
OEEwLongDiphthong:        *x*ēo*w*w*j*ą     <- SC033
OEWWSimplification:       *x*ēo*w*j*ą       <- SC031
OEVelarFricativePalatalization: *ç*ēo*w*j*ą
OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope:    *ç*ēo*w*j
OEIUmlaut:                *ç*īe*w*j
OEJLossAfterHeavy:        *ç*īe*w
OldEnglishOrthography:    h*īe*w
```

SC029 and SC030 do not appear in this trace, which is the point of the row.
The two types share the geminate and then part company exactly as Campbell
describes: *hay* loses its `*w` and keeps its `*j`, surfacing as *hīeġ*, while
*hue* loses its `*j` and keeps its `*w`, surfacing as *hīew*.

## 9. Unchanged conclusions of 11aa99e8

- **SC029 to SC030 remains genuine historical feeding.** SC029 still produces
  secondary `*au`, SC030 still fronts it. R&T p. 173: "These new *au also
  underwent the development to éa."
- **SC030's identity is untouched.** It remains Anglo-Frisian brightening
  applied to the first element of `*au`, English in scope, confidence A. The
  large majority of the rows it fires on carry inherited `*au` and establish
  it independently of the two secondary inputs; the repair concerns only how
  those secondary inputs reach it.
- **SC030 to SC032 remains feeding**, with the no-output displacement set
  still classified technical.
- **No reorder.** The disjointness of SC030 and SC043 proved in 11aa99e8 is
  unaffected.

## 10. Effect on outputs and fingerprints

No Old English surface output changed. The equivalence report continues to
find every row identical between production and sandbox.

Changed fingerprints, each an explicit consequence of the repair:

| Artifact | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `germanic-aligned-final.tsv` sha256 `c2ed8023` to `4a4c3bf0` | *hay* protoform corrected in 4 rows |
| `germanic.txt` sha256 `eff0fe0b` to `7ef79508` | SC010 `*w` branch added, SC029 singleton branches removed |
| `oe_full_trace_report.txt` | *hay* provenance, plus SC010 now firing for *hay* and *strew* |
| `rule_coverage_census.tsv` | SC010 gains its two `*awj` witnesses |

The `*iwj` follow-up then added *hue*, which changes the corpus fingerprint
again and adds one trace block and one witness to each rule the new row
exercises. No previously present row changed its output.

This is a diagnosed scientific correction, not a rebaseline.

## 11. Deferred, carried forward

1. **Foma identifier renames.** `OEAwjGlideFormation` is plainly misleading:
   the change is neither glide formation nor a singleton-input rule.
   `OEAuFronting` is also weaker than SC030's established identity. Both are
   discharged in the behaviour-neutral commit that follows this one, once the
   SC030/SC043 ontology and the `*iwj` question were settled.
2. **The `*ja`-stem adjective inflection.** The cascade does not model the
   inflectional `*-e` of that class: `*grōnijaz` yields *grēn* for *grēne* and
   `*míldijaz` yields *mild* for *milde*. This is why Campbell's headline
   `*iwj` example, *nīowe* 'new', could not be used as the witness in §5.2.
   It is a morphological gap, unconnected to gemination, and is logged here
   for a later dedicated pass.
3. **SC010's other gaps.** `*þ` and `*z` are absent from the rule. R&T p. 52
   establish `*z` as a genuine exception, so its absence is correct; `*þ` was
   not investigated here and is out of scope.
4. **SC032 scope**, unchanged from 11aa99e8 §11. SC032 appears to combine
   general English `*æu` > *ēa* material with specifically West Saxon
   developments, and SC031 `OEWWSimplification` is scoped to West Saxon
   although `*ww` degemination looks more general. Both are observations for
   the next bounded task, not conclusions of this one.
5. **`docs/refs.bib` `Hogg1992` pointer defect**, unchanged from 11aa99e8
   §11.4. Repaired in the hygiene commit that follows this one.
