# An Old English sequence from the West Saxon diphthong sequence to r-metathesis

## Introduction

This section follows an ordered stretch of Old English sound changes from the West Saxon diphthong sequence, weak prefixes, medial unstressed-vowel reshaping, and final-syllable loss through brightening, breaking, restoration, palatalization, weak-tail reduction, contraction, and r-metathesis.

Some chapters treat broad vowel histories, while others record smaller rules whose value lies in the witness words that fix their place within the finite-state sequence.

# West Saxon diphthong sequence

## Historical discussion of the West Saxon diphthong sequence

The four rules gathered here belong to one West Saxon diphthongal zone, but they do not all arise from a single historical event. Campbell discusses inherited \emph{aw}/\emph{ew} outcomes, palatal-triggered diphthongization, and later Anglian smoothing in connected but separate parts of the vowel history, and Hogg likewise treats the palatal-diphthong side as real yet uneven [@Campbell1959, pp. 46, 53--54, 65--70, 95--96, §§120, 135--136, 170--176, 185, 223--227; @Hogg1992, pp. 106--107, 111--112].

The closest interaction inside the sequence is between [SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification) and [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong), which together shape *dēaw* ‘dew’ and *hēawan* ‘hew’. [SC032 OEDiphthongLeveling](#rule-OEDiphthongLeveling) and [SC033 OEEwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEEwLongDiphthong) still belong here, but they point to different parts of the same history: [SC032 OEDiphthongLeveling](#rule-OEDiphthongLeveling) regularizes a wider diphthongal field, while [SC033 OEEwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEEwLongDiphthong) carries the long \emph{ēow} side into the later environment of [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking).

## Historical discussion of WW simplification

West Germanic \emph{ww} sequences lie behind forms such as *dēaw* ‘dew’ and *hēawan* ‘hew’, and Campbell treats them as part of the early West Germanic diphthong history [@Campbell1959, p. 46, §120].

[SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification) is the first explicit step in that sequence. It is small in form, but the later long-diphthong outcomes depend on it.

## SC031. Simplification of \emph{*ww} sequences (`OEWWSimplification`) {#rule-OEWWSimplification}

The implementation states the simplification directly.

```foma
define OEWWSimplification [
    {*w} {*w} -> {*w}
];
```

In prose, the rule reduces a doubled \emph{w} to a single \emph{w}. That simplification is what allows the later \emph{ēaw} rule to work with the shape seen in *dēaw* and *hēawan*.

Its ordinary historical chronology is one-sided. If the rule is delayed until after [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong), PGmc \emph{*dáwwō} yields [*dawu*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *dēaw* ‘dew’, and PGmc \emph{*xáwwaną} yields [*hawan*]{.pred} rather than expected *hēawan* ‘hew’. This shows that [SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification) must come before [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong). A farther-left computational break is also visible: PGmc \emph{*fédwōr} yields [*fēowwer*]{.pred} instead of expected OE *fēower* ‘four’, and PGmc \emph{*xáwwją} yields [*hēai*]{.pred} instead of expected *hīeġ* ‘hay’. Because that break appears only before the earlier sequence is divided into ordinary historical rules, it does not identify a normal earlier boundary for [SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification).

## Historical discussion of diphthong leveling

By the time the sequence reaches forms such as *hēafod* ‘head’, diphthongal outcomes are already being redistributed across a wider set of words. Campbell's discussion of smoothing and related later monophthongization is the clearest handbook anchor for that layer of the history, even though the rule kept here is more tightly drawn than any single textbook label [@Campbell1959, pp. 95--96, §§223--227].

This makes [SC032 OEDiphthongLeveling](#rule-OEDiphthongLeveling) a real member of the sequence, even if its evidence is less self-contained than the *dēaw* / *hēawan* pair.

## SC032. Leveling of diphthongal outputs (`OEDiphthongLeveling`) {#rule-OEDiphthongLeveling}

The implementation keeps the leveling rule explicit.

```foma
define OEDiphthongLeveling [
    {*aeu} -> {*ēa},
    {*áeu} -> {*ēa},
    {*eu} -> {*ēo},
    {*éu} -> {*ēo},
    {*iu} -> {*ēo},
    {*íu} -> {*ēo},
    {*e} {*u} -> {*eo},
    {*é} {*u} -> {*éo},
    {*i} {*u} -> {*eo}
];
```

In prose, the rule regularizes several diphthongal outcomes into the West Saxon patterns that appear later in the sequence. It is the step that helps keep forms such as *hēafod* ‘head’ in their expected shape.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before SC030 OEAuFronting, PGmc \emph{*galáubijaną}, \emph{*báug}, and \emph{*bráudą} fail to produce output at all (\emph{+?}) instead of yielding expected OE *ġelīefan* ‘believe’, *bēag* ‘bow’, and *brēad* ‘bread’, alongside fifteen other failed derivations. If it is delayed until after [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering), PGmc \emph{*xáubudą} yields [*hēafud*]{.pred} rather than expected *hēafod* ‘head’. This shows that SC030 OEAuFronting must come before [SC032 OEDiphthongLeveling](#rule-OEDiphthongLeveling), and that [SC032 OEDiphthongLeveling](#rule-OEDiphthongLeveling) must come before [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering). The earlier side is real, but it is expressed as failed derivations rather than as alternate surface forms.

## Historical discussion of long \emph{ēow}

The long \emph{ēow} forms of *ċēowan* ‘chew’, *fēower* ‘four’, and *cnēow* ‘knee’ belong to the same West Saxon vowel region, though their clearest ordering relation points forward. Campbell's treatment of early \emph{eu} in Old English and Ringe and Taylor's examples from *chew*, *four*, and *knee* show that this is a real part of the diphthong history [@Campbell1959, pp. 53--54, §136; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 188, 202].

That makes [SC033 OEEwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEEwLongDiphthong) an essential member of the sequence, even though its strongest boundary lies ahead at [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking).

## SC033. Long \emph{ēow} before following vowels and weak endings (`OEEwLongDiphthong`) {#rule-OEEwLongDiphthong}

The implementation states the long-diphthong development directly.

```foma
define OEEwLongDiphthong [
    {*e} {*w} -> {*ēo} {*w} || _ OEEwLongContext,
    {*i} {*w} -> {*ēo} {*w} || _ OEEwLongContext,
    {*é} {*w} -> {*ēo} {*w} || _ OEEwLongContext,
    {*í} {*w} -> {*ēo} {*w} || _ OEEwLongContext
];
```

In prose, the rule turns \emph{ew} and \emph{iw} sequences into long \emph{ēow}. This is the step behind forms such as *ċēowan*, *fēower*, and *cnēow*.

Its ordinary historical chronology is one-sided. If the rule is delayed until after [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking), PGmc \emph{*kéwwaną} yields [*ċeowan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *ċēowan* ‘chew’, PGmc \emph{*fédwōr} yields [*feower*]{.pred} rather than expected *fēower* ‘four’, and PGmc \emph{*knéwą} yields [*cneow*]{.pred} rather than expected *cnēow* ‘knee’. This shows that [SC033 OEEwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEEwLongDiphthong) must come before [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking). A farther-left computational break also appears when the search reaches undivided earlier material: PGmc \emph{*fédwōr} yields [*feower*]{.pred} instead of *fēower*. Because that break does not cross an ordinary historical rule, it does not identify a normal earlier boundary for [SC033 OEEwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEEwLongDiphthong).

## Historical discussion of long \emph{ēaw}

After [SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification) has reduced \emph{ww} to single \emph{w}, the remaining \emph{aw} sequence can develop into the long \emph{ēaw} seen in *dēaw* and *hēawan*. Campbell treats these outputs in the early diphthong history of West Germanic and Old English [@Campbell1959, pp. 46, 53--54, §§120, 135--136].

[SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong) therefore closes the nearest local pair in the chapter and also points onward to [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening).

## SC034. Long \emph{ēaw} before following vowels (`OEAwLongDiphthong`) {#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong}

The implementation keeps the long-\emph{ēaw} step explicit.

```foma
define OEAwLongDiphthong [
    {*a} {*w} -> {*ēa} {*w} || _ [EnglishStarVocalic | {*ô}],
    {*á} {*w} -> {*ḗa} {*w} || _ [EnglishStarVocalic | {*ô}]
];
```

In prose, the rule turns \emph{aw} before a following vowel into long \emph{ēaw}. This is the stage that yields forms such as *dēaw* and *hēawan*.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification), PGmc \emph{*dáwwō} yields [*dawu*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *dēaw* ‘dew’, and PGmc \emph{*xáwwaną} yields [*hawan*]{.pred} rather than expected *hēawan* ‘hew’. If it is delayed until after [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening), PGmc \emph{*skáwōjaną} yields [*sċawian*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *sċēawian* ‘show’, PGmc \emph{*skáwōθi} yields [*sċawaþ*]{.pred} rather than expected *sċēawaþ*, and PGmc \emph{*stráwą} yields [*stræw*]{.pred} rather than expected *strēaw* ‘straw’. This shows that [SC031 OEWWSimplification](#rule-OEWWSimplification) must come before [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong), and that [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong) must come before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening).

# Prefix and compound adjustments

## Historical discussion of prefixal \emph{*a}-reduction

Weakly stressed prefixes can lose their older low vowel early in Old English, and that is the historical setting for [SC035 OEPrefixAReduction](#rule-OEPrefixAReduction). Campbell treats the small but real class of pretonic losses directly, while Ringe and Taylor's derivation of \emph{*galaubijana} gives the clearest comparative witness for the same development [@Campbell1959, p. 147, §354; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 245; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 267].

The result is a modest rule with a narrow historical range. It matters because it gives prefixed forms the weak vowel shape that later vocalic rules inherit.

## SC035. Reduction of prefixal \emph{*a} (`OEPrefixAReduction`) {#rule-OEPrefixAReduction}

The implementation states the prefixal reduction directly.

```foma
define OEPrefixAReduction [
    {*a} -> {*ĕ}
        || .#. {*g} _
           [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]
           EnglishStarVocalic
];
```

In prose, the rule reduces prefixal \emph{*ga-} to unstressed \emph{*ge-}. This is the step that gives forms such as *ġelīefan* ‘believe’ their expected prefix vowel.

Its chronology is one-sided but concrete. If the rule is delayed until after [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening), PGmc \emph{*galáubijaną} yields [*ġealīefan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *ġelīefan* ‘believe’. This shows that [SC035 OEPrefixAReduction](#rule-OEPrefixAReduction) must come before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening). The earlier direction remains boundary-limited in current testing: the search reaches bundled earlier material without finding an ordinary historical break, so the card does not yet show what this rule must follow.

## Historical discussion of inter-stress raising

The strongest member of this chapter is [SC036 OEInterStressRaising](#rule-OEInterStressRaising). Campbell's discussion of *weorold* / *weoruld* and Ringe and Taylor's derivation of \emph{*weraldu} > \emph{*weruldu} > OE *weorold* place the rule squarely in the history of low-stress medial vowels [@Campbell1959, pp. 141--142, §§338--339; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 322, §6.3.3].

This is more than a small spelling adjustment. The rule changes the vowel that stands between stronger stress peaks, which is why its witnesses remain so useful for chronology.

## SC036. Raising of medial \emph{*a} between stress peaks (`OEInterStressRaising`) {#rule-OEInterStressRaising}

The implementation keeps both parts of the raising rule together.

```foma
define OEInterStressRaising [
    {*a} -> {*u}
        || PGmcStarVowel EnglishStarConsonant* _
           [EnglishStarConsonant - {*j}]+ [{*u}|{*ū}],
    {*à} -> {*u}
];
```

In prose, the rule raises medial unstressed \emph{*a} to \emph{*u} in the low-stress position between stronger syllables. This is the stage behind forms such as *sāwol* ‘soul’ and *weorold* ‘world’.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before SC019 NWGmcFinalLongORaising, PGmc \emph{*sáiwalō} yields [*sāwel*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *sāwol* ‘soul’. If it is delayed until after [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering), PGmc \emph{*sáiwalō} yields [*sāwul*]{.pred} rather than expected *sāwol*, and PGmc \emph{*wír-àldu} yields [*weoruld*]{.pred} rather than expected *weorold* ‘world’. This shows that SC019 NWGmcFinalLongORaising must come before [SC036 OEInterStressRaising](#rule-OEInterStressRaising), and that [SC036 OEInterStressRaising](#rule-OEInterStressRaising) must come before [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering).

The earlier boundary is real, but it reaches farther back than the immediate neighborhood. The later boundary is the more local result inside this part of the sequence.

## Historical discussion of compound linking syncope

Compound members with weakened force often lose or reshape their linking vowels, and Campbell treats that broad pattern through reduced second elements, connecting vowels, and obscured compounds [@Campbell1959, pp. 148--149, §§356--357; @Campbell1959, p. 153, §367; @Campbell1959, p. 159, §§386--387].

That is the historical setting for [SC037 OECompoundLinkingSyncope](#rule-OECompoundLinkingSyncope). The rule is worth stating explicitly because compounds such as *reġnboga* ‘rainbow’ depend on it, even though its chronology is narrower and less ordinary-historical than the rule beside it.

## SC037. Syncope of compound linking vowels (`OECompoundLinkingSyncope`) {#rule-OECompoundLinkingSyncope}

The implementation deletes the weak linking vowel in the relevant compound environment.

```foma
define OECompoundLinkingSyncope [
    [{*a}|{*i}|{*u}] -> 0
        || PGmcStarAcuteVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _
           OEAnyConsonant+ PGmcStarGraveVowel
];
```

In prose, the rule removes a weak linking vowel inside compounds before a following grave-stressed member. This is the step that yields forms such as *reġnboga* ‘rainbow’.

Its chronology is boundary-limited. If the rule is delayed until after SC038 OEStripSecondaryStress, PGmc \emph{*régna-bùgô} yields [*reġnefoga*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *reġnboga* ‘rainbow’. This shows that [SC037 OECompoundLinkingSyncope](#rule-OECompoundLinkingSyncope) must come before SC038 OEStripSecondaryStress, but that conclusion is technical rather than ordinary-historical because SC038 OEStripSecondaryStress is not an ordinary sound change. The earlier direction also reaches bundled earlier material without finding a historical break, so the present evidence remains one-sided and boundary-limited.

\newpage

# Medial unstressed vowel changes

## Historical discussion of medial unstressed vowel changes

These two rules belong together because the same low-stress vocalic region supplies their witnesses, and the order evidence ties them together through *wuduwe* ‘widow’. Campbell discusses both the \emph{w}-conditioned \emph{u} forms and the later *weorold* / *weoruld* alternation, while Ringe and Taylor give the same connection comparatively in \emph{*widuwon-}, \emph{*weraldu}, and \emph{*jugunþi} [@Campbell1959, p. 92, §218; @Campbell1959, p. 140, §332; @Campbell1959, pp. 141--142, §§338--339; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 267; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 322, §6.3.3].

The pair is therefore historically tighter than a merely adjacent grouping. [SC039 OEWICombinativeUUmlaut](#rule-OEWICombinativeUUmlaut) is the narrower rule, but it feeds the exact vowel sequence that [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering) must then reshape.

## SC039. Combinative \emph{*u}-umlaut in \emph{wi}-forms (`OEWICombinativeUUmlaut`) {#rule-OEWICombinativeUUmlaut}

The implementation keeps the \emph{w}-conditioned adjustment very small.

```foma
define OEWICombinativeUUmlaut [
    {*í} -> {*ú}
        || .#. {*w} _ EnglishStarConsonant [{*u} | {*o}]
];
```

In prose, the rule changes the first vowel of \emph{wi}-forms under the following back-vowel conditions. This is the step that helps produce OE *wuduwe* ‘widow’.

Its chronology is clear on the later side. If the rule is delayed until after [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering), PGmc \emph{*wíduwōn} yields [*wudowe*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *wuduwe* ‘widow’. This shows that [SC039 OEWICombinativeUUmlaut](#rule-OEWICombinativeUUmlaut) must come before [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering). The earlier direction remains one-sided in current testing: the search reaches bundled earlier material without producing an ordinary historical break.

## SC040. Lowering of medial unstressed \emph{*u} (`OEMedUnstressedULowering`) {#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering}

The implementation states the lowering rule directly.

```foma
define OEMedUnstressedULowering [
    {*u} -> {*o}
        || [EnglishStarVocalic - [{*u}|{*ū}|{*ú}]]
           [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]+ _
           [[EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant] - {*m}]
];
```

In prose, the rule lowers medial unstressed \emph{*u} to \emph{*o} in the relevant consonantal environment. This is the stage behind forms such as *weorold* ‘world’.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC039 OEWICombinativeUUmlaut](#rule-OEWICombinativeUUmlaut), PGmc \emph{*wíduwōn} yields [*wudowe*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *wuduwe* ‘widow’. If it is delayed until after [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening), PGmc \emph{*júgunθ} yields [*ġeogoþ*]{.pred} rather than expected *ġeoguþ* ‘youth’. This shows that [SC039 OEWICombinativeUUmlaut](#rule-OEWICombinativeUUmlaut) must come before [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering), and that [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering) must come before [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening).

The later relation to [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) is real, but it is much broader than the local *widow* pair. The closest chronological result inside this chapter is still the reciprocal relation between [SC039 OEWICombinativeUUmlaut](#rule-OEWICombinativeUUmlaut) and [SC040 OEMedUnstressedULowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedULowering).

\newpage

# Final bare-\emph{a} loss

## Historical discussion

The handbooks treat loss of final short low vowels as part of a broader erosion of final syllables, but that broader background still supports a short explicit rule here [@Campbell1959, p. 143, §341; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 60--61].

This change belongs after the medial unstressed vowel changes because it affects final syllables and leaves the low-stress interior of the word behind. It also belongs before restoration because later fronted forms depend on the environment it leaves behind.

## SC041. Loss of final bare \emph{*a} (`PWGmcFinalBareALoss`) {#rule-PWGmcFinalBareALoss}

The implementation keeps the loss of the final vowel explicit.

```foma
define PWGmcFinalBareALoss [
    {*a} -> 0 || _ .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule deletes a surviving final bare \emph{*a}. This is the step that prevents a large class of words from carrying a spurious final vowel into Old English.

Its chronology is broad on the left and sharper on the right. If the rule is moved before SC020 PGmcFinalZDeletion, PGmc \emph{*bárdaz} yields [*bearda*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *beard* ‘beard’, and PGmc \emph{*kámbaz} yields [*camba*]{.pred} rather than expected *camb* ‘comb’. If it is delayed until after [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration), PGmc \emph{*kráftaz} yields [*craft*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *cræft* ‘craft’, and PGmc \emph{*dágaz} yields [*dag*]{.pred} rather than expected *dæġ* ‘day’. This shows that SC020 PGmcFinalZDeletion must come before [SC041 PWGmcFinalBareALoss](#rule-PWGmcFinalBareALoss), and that [SC041 PWGmcFinalBareALoss](#rule-PWGmcFinalBareALoss) must come before [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration).

The earlier boundary reaches across a wide stretch of the cascade and is best read as a broad limit, not a local pair. The later boundary is the nearer result: restoration needs final bare-\emph{a} loss to have happened already.

\newpage

# Surviving bimoric \emph{*ō} unrounding

## Historical discussion

This is a narrow prefatory rule. The handbooks do not isolate one large independent sound change under exactly this label. Still, the surviving bimoric \emph{*ō} pathway behind forms such as *ræste* ‘rest’ needs to be stated explicitly if the sequence is to begin cleanly before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening). Campbell, Hogg, and Ringe and Taylor all make the surrounding fronting and restoration region historically intelligible even when this particular feeder step remains model-shaped [@Campbell1959, pp. 52, 60, §§131, 157--158; @Hogg1992, pp. 101, 119; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 157--158, 189--190].

That is enough for a short reader-facing note. The rule belongs here because it closes a small architectural seam on the left side of the brightening chapter, not because it should rival the broader historical weight of the chapters that follow.

## SC042. Unrounding of the surviving bimoric \emph{*ō} (`PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding`) {#rule-PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding}

The implementation keeps the step very small and explicit.

```foma
define PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding [
    {*ō} -> {*ā} || EnglishStarVocalic [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]+ _ .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule unrounds a surviving bimoric \emph{*ō} to \emph{*ā} in the environment that later feeds the fronted and restored outcome in forms such as *ræste* ‘rest’.

Its chronology is exact on both sides, but the witness base is very narrow. If the rule is moved before SC020 PGmcFinalZDeletion, PGmc \emph{*rástōz} yields [*rasta*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *ræste* ‘rest’. If the rule is delayed until after [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening), the same PGmc form again yields [*rasta*]{.pred} instead of *ræste*. This shows that SC020 PGmcFinalZDeletion must come before [SC042 PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding](#rule-PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding), and that [SC042 PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding](#rule-PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding) must come before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening).

The rule is therefore real, but still best treated as a short feeder note. Its entire chronology is carried by the single *rest* 'rest' derivation.

\newpage

# Anglo-Frisian brightening

## Historical discussion

This chapter carries more historical weight than the narrow note before it. The change usually called Anglo-Frisian Brightening or First Fronting turns low \emph{*a} into fronted \emph{*æ}-type outcomes outside nasal environments, and later Old English developments repeatedly presuppose that fronted stage even when they partly conceal it. Campbell gives the classical statement of the fronting itself, Hogg supplies the standard modern label pair, and Ringe and Taylor make the local chronology with breaking and restoration unusually clear [@Campbell1959, p. 52, §131; @Hogg1992, pp. 101, 119; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 157--158, 189--190; @Fulk2018, pp. 73--74, §§4.12--4.13].

That is why the chapter is more than a general handbook excursus. The finite-state evidence shows that the rule fronts a vowel and also creates the input that [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) must read and that [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration) later partly reverses before back vowels.

## SC043. Fronting of low \emph{*a} outside nasal environments (`AngloFrisianBrightening`) {#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening}

The implementation keeps the brightening as one composed rule.

```foma
define AngloFrisianBrightening [
    AngloFrisianBrighteningUnstressed .o.
    AngloFrisianBrighteningStressed .o.
    AngloFrisianBrighteningLongFinal
];
```

In prose, the rule fronts low \emph{*a} to \emph{*æ}-type outcomes outside nasal environments. The composed definition reflects the fact that the transducer handles stressed, unstressed, and long-final branches separately even though the historical rule is normally discussed more compactly.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC042 PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding](#rule-PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding), PGmc \emph{*rástōz} yields [*rasta*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *ræste* ‘rest’. If it is delayed until after [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking), PGmc \emph{*sláxaną} yields \emph{sleaan | slēaan} rather than expected OE *slēan* ‘slay’. This shows that [SC042 PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding](#rule-PWGmcSurvivingBimoricOUnrounding) must come before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening), and that [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening) must come before [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking).

That position is historically apt. The rule is early enough to feed later breaking, but not so early that the surviving-bimoric \emph{*ō} pathway on its left can be ignored. It is one of the main vocalic pivots of this part of the sequence.

\newpage

# Breaking and velar-fricative palatalization

## Historical discussion of breaking and velar-fricative palatalization

These two rules belong together because the first establishes the local vocalic environment that the second must read. Breaking creates the \emph{eo}-type outputs before \emph{h}, \emph{rC}, and \emph{lC}, and the following velar-fricative palatalization then operates in that already reshaped environment. Campbell, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all make breaking a standard part of the post-brightening sequence, while the local fricative palatalization is historically narrower but still clear enough to stand beside it [@Campbell1959, pp. 54, 166, §§139, 405--406; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 168--169, 213--214, §§6.2.1--6.2.3, 6.4.1--6.4.2; @Fulk2018, pp. 73--74, §4.13].

That interaction is close enough to justify a shared historical discussion. Even so, the hierarchy remains uneven. Breaking is the clearer handbook center, while velar-fricative palatalization is the tighter local follower whose chronology becomes especially visible through the *feoh* and *feohtan* type derivations.

## SC044. Breaking before \emph{h}, \emph{rC}, and \emph{lC} (`OEBreaking`) {#rule-OEBreaking}

The implementation keeps the breaking stage as one composed rule.

```foma
define OEBreaking OEBreakingA
    .o. OEBreakingE
    .o. OEBreakingI;
```

In prose, the rule breaks front vowels into diphthongal outcomes before the relevant consonantal environments. This is the step that yields forms such as *feoh* ‘fee’ and *feohtan* ‘fight’.

Its chronology is concrete on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening), PGmc \emph{*sláxaną} yields \emph{sleaan | slēaan} rather than expected OE *slēan* ‘slay’. If it is delayed until after [SC045 OEVelarFricativePalatalization](#rule-OEVelarFricativePalatalization), PGmc \emph{*féxu} yields [*fehu*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *feoh* ‘fee’, and PGmc \emph{*féxtaną} yields [*fehtan*]{.pred} rather than expected *feohtan* ‘fight’. This shows that [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening) must come before [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking), and that [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) must come before [SC045 OEVelarFricativePalatalization](#rule-OEVelarFricativePalatalization).

That two-sided local seam is why [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) works so well as the main center of the pair.

## SC045. Palatalization of velar fricatives beside front vowels (`OEVelarFricativePalatalization`) {#rule-OEVelarFricativePalatalization}

The following rule handles the local fricative palatalization.

```foma
define OEVelarFricativePalatalization [
    {*x} -> {*ç} || _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*ɣ} -> {*j} || _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*x} -> {*ç} || EnglishStarFrontVowel _,
    {*ɣ} -> {*j} || EnglishStarFrontVowel _,
    {*x} -> {*ç} || _ {*j},
    {*ɣ} -> {*j} || _ {*j}
]
    .o. EnglishStarAlphabet*;
```

In prose, the rule palatalizes \emph{*x} and \emph{*ɣ} beside front vowels or before \emph{*j}. In this chapter it is the local follower to breaking, not a general article on all Old English palatalization.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking), PGmc \emph{*féxu} yields [*fehu*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *feoh*, and PGmc \emph{*féxtaną} yields [*fehtan*]{.pred} rather than expected *feohtan*. If it is delayed until after [SC060 OEWsPalatalUmlaut](#rule-OEWsPalatalUmlaut), PGmc \emph{*séxs} yields [*sihs*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *six*. This shows that [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) must come before [SC045 OEVelarFricativePalatalization](#rule-OEVelarFricativePalatalization), and that [SC045 OEVelarFricativePalatalization](#rule-OEVelarFricativePalatalization) must come before [SC060 OEWsPalatalUmlaut](#rule-OEWsPalatalUmlaut).

The later relation to [SC060 OEWsPalatalUmlaut](#rule-OEWsPalatalUmlaut) remains a cross-reference, not a reason to enlarge the chapter. The core local pair is still [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) and [SC045 OEVelarFricativePalatalization](#rule-OEVelarFricativePalatalization).

# A-restoration and nasal changes

## Historical discussion of A-restoration

The first member of this chapter is the clearest historical hinge in the post-brightening region. Campbell's restoration of \emph{a} before following back vowels and Ringe and Taylor's discussion of later retraction describe the same phenomenon that the transducer keeps explicit here [@Campbell1959, pp. 60--61, §§157--159; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 189--190, §6.3.1; @Fulk2018, p. 74, §4.13]. The rule matters because Anglo-Frisian fronting is often visible only through the later environments that restore some of its outcomes to back \emph{a}.

That makes [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration) the source-backed hinge of the chapter. The nasal rules that follow belong in the same neighborhood, but they do not carry quite the same historical weight in the handbooks.

## SC046. Restoration of \emph{*a} before following back vowels (`OEARestoration`) {#rule-OEARestoration}

The implementation keeps the restoration step explicit.

```foma
define OEARestoration (
    {*æ} -> {*a} || _
        OEARestorationIntervening OEARestorationTriggerVowel
        - OEARestorationIntervening OEARestorationWeakTailVowel
);
```

In prose, the rule changes earlier fronted \emph{*æ} back to \emph{*a} before the relevant following back-vowel environments. This is the step that turns fronted forms such as *bæcan* back into the attested OE *bacan* ‘bake’.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening), PGmc \emph{*bákaną} yields [*bæcan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *bacan* ‘bake’, and PGmc \emph{*fáraną} yields [*færan*]{.pred} rather than expected *faran* ‘fare’. If it is delayed until after [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization), PGmc \emph{*bákaną} again yields [*bæcan*]{.pred} instead of *bacan*, and PGmc \emph{*wádaną} yields [*wædan*]{.pred} instead of *wadan* ‘wade’. This shows that [SC043 AngloFrisianBrightening](#rule-AngloFrisianBrightening) must come before [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration), and that [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration) must come before [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization).

The rule is therefore not a decorative aftereffect of brightening. It is a real restoration hinge with a positive local window on both sides.

## Historical discussion of heavy-syllable nasal loss and secondary nasalization

The remaining two rules are more tightly paired inside the model than they are in ordinary handbook naming. Their connection is derivational and broad. [SC047 OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope](#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope) removes the final nasalized vowel in heavy syllables, while [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization) marks the preceding \emph{a} before final \emph{n}. The result is a large reciprocal failure set if the two are inverted. Campbell's discussion of later nasal loss and the later back-mutation environment gives the broader background, while Ringe and Taylor help with the later cross-reference toward [SC059 OEBackMutation](#rule-OEBackMutation) [@Campbell1959, pp. 86, 166, §§205--206, 403; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 319, §6.9.4].

That shared discussion is justified because the two rules interact directly inside the derivation. Even so, the hierarchy remains visible: the pair is a strong computational core, but less like a classical textbook chapter than [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration).

## SC047. Heavy-syllable nasal apocope of final \emph{*ą} (`OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope`) {#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope}

The implementation keeps the apocope step short.

```foma
define OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope [
    {*ą} -> 0 || OEAnyConsonant _ .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule deletes final nasalized \emph{*ą} after a heavy syllable. This is the step that prevents a large class of forms from retaining spurious weak final vowels.

Its chronology is real on both sides, though not equally local. If the rule is moved before [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong), PGmc \emph{*stráwą} yields [*stræw*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *strēaw* ‘straw’. If it is delayed until after [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization), PGmc \emph{*bákaną} yields [*bacen*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *bacan* ‘bake’, and PGmc \emph{*bíndaną} yields [*binden*]{.pred} rather than expected *bindan* ‘bind’, alongside a very broad \emph{-en} failure set. This shows that [SC034 OEAwLongDiphthong](#rule-OEAwLongDiphthong) must come before [SC047 OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope](#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope), and that [SC047 OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope](#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope) must come before [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization).

The earlier side is narrow, but the later side is one of the broadest reciprocal failure sets in this part of the model.

## SC048. Secondary nasalization before final \emph{*n} (`OESecondaryNasalization`) {#rule-OESecondaryNasalization}

The following rule states the nasalization step directly.

```foma
define OESecondaryNasalization [
    {*a} -> {*ą} || _ {*n} .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule nasalizes \emph{*a} before final \emph{n}. This is the step that helps keep the live \emph{-an} outcomes distinct from the spurious \emph{-en} forms that appear if the late nasal rules are misordered.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC047 OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope](#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope), PGmc \emph{*bákaną} yields [*bacen*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *bacan*, and PGmc \emph{*bíndaną} yields [*binden*]{.pred} rather than expected *bindan*, representing the same broad reciprocal failure set. If it is delayed until after [SC059 OEBackMutation](#rule-OEBackMutation), PGmc \emph{*stélaną} yields [*steolan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *stelan* ‘steal’, and PGmc \emph{*wébaną} yields [*weofan*]{.pred} rather than expected *wefan* ‘weave’. This shows that [SC047 OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope](#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope) must come before [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization), and that [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization) must come before [SC059 OEBackMutation](#rule-OEBackMutation).

That combination explains the chapter’s internal hierarchy. [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration) is the clearest historical hinge, while [SC047 OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope](#rule-OEHeavySyllableNasalApocope) and [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization) form the stronger reciprocal nasal core.

# B allophony and Sievers-law syncope

## Historical discussion of B allophony

The first change is the positional alternation of Germanic \emph{*b}. Hogg
states the Old English distribution clearly: /b/ is a stop initially, after
nasals, and in gemination, while the same segment is otherwise realized as a
voiced bilabial fricative [@Hogg1992, pp. 101--102]. Ringe and Taylor support
the broader West Germanic background by treating Proto-West-Germanic \emph{*b} as a
segment whose stop and fricative values depend on position
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 121], and Luick's spelling evidence shows the same labial
fricative pattern in Old English [@Luick1914, p. 107].

This is a narrow consonantal distribution with limited independent scope, but it
matters because later derivations already assume that the alternation is in
place.

## SC049. Distribution of \emph{*b} after vowels and liquids (`PGmcBAllophony`) {#rule-PGmcBAllophony}

The first rule formalizes the stop-fricative alternation of Germanic \emph{*b}.

```foma
define PGmcBAllophony [
    {*b} -> {*β} || PGmcStarVocalic _,
    {*b} -> {*β} || [{*l} | {*r}] _
] .o. [
    {*β} -> {*b} || _ {*b}
];
```

In prose, the rule says that \emph{*b} becomes a fricative after vowels and
liquids, while geminate \emph{*bb} keeps the stop value.

Historically, this is the sort of narrow distributional statement that the
handbooks place within the consonant system and discuss only briefly on its own.
Even so, it matters because later derivations assume that the
alternation is already in place. The clearest tested consequence appears in
*reġnboga* ‘rainbow’. If the rule is moved before the earlier linking-vowel
adjustment, the derivation yields *reġnfoga* ‘rainbow’ rather than expected OE
*reġnboga* ‘rainbow’. This shows that [SC037 OECompoundLinkingSyncope](#rule-OECompoundLinkingSyncope) must come
before [SC049 PGmcBAllophony](#rule-PGmcBAllophony).
No equally sharp later lexical breakpoint emerges within the tested sequence, so
the rule has no explicit later boundary within the present sequence.

## Historical discussion of Sievers-law syncope

Sievers' Law belongs to a different historical problem. It is a prosodic and
morphological adjustment in heavy stems, not a distributional allophone of a
stop consonant. Adamczyk treats the Old English reflexes of the law as real
historical material in weak verbs and related formations
[@Adamczyk2001, pp. 61--72]. Fulk gives the compact comparative summary through
familiar forms such as *biddan* ‘ask’, *sellan* ‘give’, and *nerian* ‘save’
[@Fulk2018, p. 127, §6.15].

That makes the change historically narrower but chronologically important. It is
the last small feeder before the palatalization sequence begins in earnest, and
its place in the cascade is clearer than that of the preceding allophony rule.

## SC050. Sievers-law syncope (`SieversLawSyncope`) {#rule-SieversLawSyncope}

The second rule removes the Sievers-law \emph{*i} before \emph{*j} after a consonant.

```foma
define SieversLawSyncope [
    {*i} -> 0 || [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant] _ {*j}
];
```

In plain language, the rule contracts the heavier \emph{*-CijV-*} sequence to
\emph{*-CjV-*}. That is why it belongs to the historical aftermath of Sievers' Law and
stands apart from the earlier stop-fricative distribution.

Its place in the sequence is clearer than that of the allophony rule. If the
change is delayed until after [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization), the cluster
behind *streċċan* ‘stretch’ is affected too late. With PGmc
\emph{*strákkijaną} in the wrong order, the derivation yields *strecċan*
‘stretch’. The expected Old English form is *streċċan* ‘stretch’. That is a real chronological
consequence. No equally precise earlier lexical breakpoint fixes how far back
the syncope must stand, so the historical picture remains asymmetric. The rule
is secure as an immediate feeder into the palatalization zone, even though its
earlier limit is less sharply bounded. The evidence therefore places
[SC050 SieversLawSyncope](#rule-SieversLawSyncope) before
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization).

\newpage

# Palatalization of \emph{*sk} to \emph{*sc}

## Historical discussion

The palatalization of \emph{*sk} to Old English \emph{*sc} is one of the recognizable early
cluster changes in the larger palatalization zone. Campbell distinguishes the
cluster from plain velars when he remarks that \emph{*sk} is especially prone to
palatalization and assibilation [@Campbell1959, p. 278, §440]. Hogg gives the
same change a clearer structural place by treating \emph{*sk} beside the palatalization
of plain velars and before the later West Saxon diphthongal developments
[@Hogg1992, pp. 106--107, 111--112]. Ringe and Taylor make the same sequence
explicit when they distinguish the earlier palatalization of velars and \emph{*sk} from
the later diphthongization after already palatal consonants
[@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 213--216, §§6.4.1, 6.5.1].

Luick is especially useful for the larger frame. He treats
the cluster change as part of a broader early movement toward palatal
articulation, while still allowing later vowel consequences to form a different
chapter of the history [@Luick1914, p. 157, §168]. Fulk's
summary is the most concise warning against overextension: Old English \emph{*sc} is
palatal except in the well-known back-vowel environments that preserve harder
outcomes [@Fulk2018, p. 28]. The result is a historically clear rule, but not an
excuse to merge the whole palatalization and umlaut region into one undivided
chapter.

## SC051. Palatalization of \emph{*sk} to \emph{*sc} (`OESkPalatalization`) {#rule-OESkPalatalization}

The implementation states the \emph{*sk} rule explicitly.

```foma
define OESkPalatalization [
    {*s} {*k} -> {*ʃ} || .#. _
] .o. [
    {*s} {*k} -> {*ʃ} || EnglishStarFrontVowel _ (EnglishStarConsonant | .#.)
] .o. [
    {*s} {*k} -> {*ʃ} || (EnglishStarConsonant | .#.) _ EnglishStarFrontVowel
] .o. [
    {*s} {*k} -> {*ʃ} || _ {*j}
] .o. [
    {*s} {*k} -> {*ʃ} || {*j} _
];
```

In prose, the rule turns \emph{*sk} into a palatal outcome in the environments
that lead to Old English \emph{*sc}.

Its historical place is between the earlier restoration and the later palatal
vowel developments. If it is moved too early, the forms behind *flasce* ‘flask’
and *wascan* ‘wash’ are fronted too soon, yielding *flæsce* ‘flask’ and
*wæscan* ‘wash’ rather than expected OE *flasce* and *wascan*. This gives the
earlier result. This shows that [SC046 OEARestoration](#rule-OEARestoration) must come before
[SC051 OESkPalatalization](#rule-OESkPalatalization). If it is moved too late, the cluster no longer feeds the later
West-Saxon diphthongal outcomes that appear in *sċeaft* ‘shaft’, *sċēar*
‘shear’, *sċēaþ* ‘sheath’, *sċēap* ‘sheep’, and *sċield* ‘shield’. That is why
the rule sits naturally beside [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) and before [SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization).

No single later wrong form is isolated for the whole group of
\emph{*sċea-* 'sea'} / \emph{*sċie-*} witnesses, but the current notes do show that the cluster
must already be palatalized before the later West-Saxon diphthongal rule
applies. This places [SC051 OESkPalatalization](#rule-OESkPalatalization)
before [SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization).

The narrower chapter shape matters. The cluster rule is real and historically
visible, but it is still only one part of the broader palatalizing sequence. The
change should therefore be read as a distinct cluster development inside that
sequence, not as a complete account of Old English palatalization.

\newpage

# Velar palatalization before front vowels

## Historical discussion

Luick places the change inside a broad early palatalizing movement. Under the
heading “Frühe Verschiebungen in palataler Richtung,” he treats English `k` and
`g` before bright vowels together with the larger field of palatal effects
[@Luick1914, p. 157, §168]. His emphasis falls on the environment first: velars
before bright vowels and in the vicinity of the palatal glide belong to one
early phonological sequence. The examples associated with that sequence, such as
*ceaster* ‘town’, *geaf* ‘gave’, *giefan* ‘give’, and *giest* ‘guest’, already
show that consonantal palatalization and later vowel effects stand close
together historically, even when they must be distinguished analytically
[@Luick1914, pp. 157--167, §§168--182].

Campbell narrows the picture by distinguishing plain velars from the especially
palatal-prone `sk` cluster. His remark that “[sk] is more prone to
palatalization and assibilation than [k]” is brief, but it makes clear that
different members of the larger palatal field need not behave identically
[@Campbell1959, p. 278, §440]. Elsewhere in the same part of the grammar he uses
forms such as *cild* ‘child’, *dæg* ‘day’, *giefan* ‘give’, and *giest*
‘guest’, which show how palatalized velars, palatal influence, and later
umlautal outcomes meet in the same region of the lexicon without collapsing
into one process [@Campbell1959, pp. 69--72, 89, §§170, 190--191].

Hogg makes the conditioning sharper still. He states that the change takes place
when the velar consonant is adjacent to and in the same syllable as a front
vowel or the palatal consonant `j` [@Hogg1992, pp. 103--104]. This formulation
is important because it moves the discussion from a broad list of palatal
outcomes to a more precise phonological environment involving adjacency and
syllable structure.

Ringe and Taylor make the chronological relation still clearer. When they write
that “after initial velars and \emph{*sk} had been palatalized” West-Saxon
diphthongization follows, plain velar palatalization becomes an earlier
consonantal stage presupposed by later vowel developments
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 215, §6.5.1]. Their own examples of the plain-velar rule,
such as \emph{weccan} ‘wake’, \emph{licgan} ‘lie’, \emph{lecgan} ‘lay’,
\emph{secg} ‘retainer’, \emph{ecg} ‘edge’, \emph{wicg} ‘horse’, and
\emph{brycg} ‘bridge’, illustrate the same point in lexical detail: front
vowels and `j` create the palatal environment in which plain `k` and `g` cease
to behave as plain velars [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 213--214, §6.4.1].

Taken together, these accounts show a gradual tightening of focus. Luick treats
palatalization as a broad early movement. Campbell distinguishes more sharply
between plain velars and the `sk` complex. Hogg specifies the adjacency and
syllable conditions more directly. Ringe and Taylor then place the plain velar
change in an explicit sequence that leads forward to later West-Saxon
diphthongization. The literature therefore supports two claims at once: the
change belongs to a larger palatalizing environment, and it must be kept
distinct from neighboring processes if the sequence of developments is to be
described accurately.

## SC052. Palatalization of \emph{*k} before front vowels and \emph{*j} (`OEVelarPalatalizationKFront`) {#rule-OEVelarPalatalizationKFront}

The first part of the implementation isolates the `k`-side environments of the
change.

```foma
define OEVelarPalatalizationKFront [
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || .#. _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || _ [{*i} | {*ī}],
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || _ {*ḯ},
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || [{*i} | {*ī}] _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || {*ḯ} _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || [{*i} | {*ī}] _ .#.,
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || {*ḯ} _ .#.
] .o. [
    {*k} {*k} -> {*ʧ} {*ʧ} || _ {*j}
] .o. [
    {*k} -> {*ʧ} || _ {*j}
] ;
```

In prose, the rule turns plain `k` into a palatal outcome before front vowels
and `j`, including the geminated environment before `j`.

Historically, this section corresponds to the core of the older discussion of
palatalized velars. It captures the environments behind forms such as *weccan*
‘wake’, *licgan* ‘lie’, and *lecgan* ‘lay’, where front vowels or `j` trigger
the palatal outcome in the first place [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 213--214,
§6.4.1]. It is also the part of the process that prepares forms later assumed by
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) and, farther on, by
[SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting).

Within the present implementation, this helper rule is not ordered separately
from the broader velar-palatalization rule below. Its chronology is therefore
that of the larger rule it feeds. If the palatalization complex is moved before
Sievers-law syncope, PGmc \emph{*strákkijaną} yields *strecċan* ‘stretch’ rather
than expected OE *streċċan* ‘stretch’. If it is delayed beyond the umlautal
core, PGmc \emph{*kūi} and \emph{*lúnganjō} yield *ċȳ* ‘cows’ and *lunġen*
‘lungs’ rather than expected OE *cȳ* and *lungen*. The shared boundary pattern
is therefore clear. [SC050 SieversLawSyncope](#rule-SieversLawSyncope) must
come before [SC052 OEVelarPalatalizationKFront](#rule-OEVelarPalatalizationKFront), and the
palatalization complex must in turn come before [SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting).

## SC052. Velar palatalization before front vowels (`OEVelarPalatalization`) {#rule-OEVelarPalatalization}

The broader rule adds the `g` environments and composes them with the `k`
palatalization rule above.

```foma
define OEVelarPalatalization [
    OEVelarPalatalizationKFront
] .o. [
    {*g} -> {*ʤ} || _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*g} -> {*ʤ} || EnglishStarFrontVowel _ .#.,
    {*g} -> {*ʤ} || EnglishStarFrontVowel _ EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*g} -> {*ʤ} || EnglishStarFrontVowel _ [EnglishStarConsonant - {*j}],
    {*g} {*g} -> {*ʤ} {*ʤ} || _ {*j}
] .o. [
    {*g} -> {*ʤ} || _ {*j}
];
```

In prose, the rule palatalizes plain `k` and `g` in front-vocalic and
`j`-adjacent environments. Writing it as a separate rule clarifies the relative
order of plain-velar palatalization, `sk`-palatalization, and umlautal
developments.

The rule belongs after the earlier syncope that prepares forms like *streċċan*
‘stretch’ and before the later umlautal rules that would otherwise
over-palatalize forms such as *cȳ* ‘cows’ and *lungen* ‘lungs’. See
[SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting) and
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) below.

If the rule is moved too early, before the syncope that prepares the consonant
cluster, it breaks the derivation that should yield *streċċan* ‘stretch’. With
PGmc \emph{*strákkijaną} in the wrong order, the model produces *strecċan*
‘stretch’; the expected Old English form is *streċċan* ‘stretch’.

If it is moved too late, after i-umlaut, it over-palatalizes forms such as
*cȳ* ‘cows’ and *lungen* ‘lungs’. PGmc \emph{*kūi} then yields *ċȳ* ‘cows’;
the expected form is *cȳ* ‘cows’. PGmc \emph{*lúnganjō} yields *lunġen*
‘lungs’; the expected form is *lungen* ‘lungs’.

These lexical failures show that [SC050 SieversLawSyncope](#rule-SieversLawSyncope)
must come before [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization)
and that [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) must come
before [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut).

Once the rule is in place, plain velars before front vowels and `j` no longer
remain plain. They become the palatal outcomes presupposed by later
developments, including the umlautal rules discussed in
[SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting). That matters for
dictionary-like forms such as *cild* ‘child’ or *dæg* ‘day’ and for the broader
relation between consonantal palatalization and later vowel-fronting processes
[@Luick1914, p. 157, §168; @Campbell1959, p. 278, §440; @RingeTaylor2014,
pp. 203--215, §§6.4.1, 6.5.1].

The evidence places the rule within a wider palatalizing environment, but it
does not require every neighboring palatal process to be merged with it. `sk`
belongs to a related but distinct development, and the later umlautal material
poses a different historical problem. The relation to the earlier syncope rule
is likewise specific and limited: the *streċċan* ‘stretch’ evidence shows a real
dependency without turning the feeder process into a coequal sound law of the
same scope.

# Post-velar \emph{*w}-loss and loss of \emph{*w} before final \emph{*i}

## Historical discussion of early \emph{*w}-loss before umlaut

The two rules gathered here are unequal in weight. The first is a narrow loss of
\emph{*w} after velars in the \emph{*ngw} sequence. Ringe and Taylor make the historical core
clear when they derive PGmc \emph{*singwan} to Old English *singan* ‘sing’
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 214, §6.4.2]. That gives the change a real comparative anchor, but
it does not turn it into a large chapter of its own. It is the kind of small
local sound change that needs a place in the sequence without claiming the status of a
major handbook law.

The second rule is historically more legible. Campbell notes the recurring loss
of \emph{*w} before \emph{*i} in unstressed position [@Campbell1959, p. 167, §406]. Ringe and Taylor
trace the development of *sǣ* ‘sea’ from earlier \emph{*saiwi-} / \emph{*sawi-}
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 257, §6.7.1], and Luick gives the same trajectory in his own
historical grammar [@Luick1914, p. 173, §187]. The chapter therefore belongs in the
stretch between plain palatalization and the umlautal core, but it should keep
the asymmetry visible: the first rule is a narrow loss in the \emph{*ngw} sequence, and the second is a
stronger glide-loss development with a specific lexical witness.

## SC053. Loss of \emph{*w} after velars (`OEPostVelarWLoss`) {#rule-OEPostVelarWLoss}

The first rule handles the \emph{*ngw} simplification.

```foma
define OEPostVelarWLoss [
    {*w} -> 0 || {*n} {*g} _
];
```

In prose, the rule removes \emph{*w} after the velar cluster in forms of the
\emph{*singwan} type.

Historically, this is a very small rule. It keeps developments such as *singan*
‘sing’ visible in the sequence, but it does not create a large family of lexical
breakpoints. Current testing does not recover a positive earlier or later
boundary: the search reaches older material on the left and the later Old
English search limit on the right with no decisive wrong form. If the rule is
moved either earlier or later within the tested sequence, no lexical witness yet
provides a sharper wrong/expected pair. The safest reading is therefore modest:
this is a local pre-umlaut rule that belongs before the umlautal chapter without
claiming a sharper chronological slot than the evidence supports.

## SC054. Loss of \emph{*w} before final \emph{*i} (`OEWLossBeforeI`) {#rule-OEWLossBeforeI}

The second rule is the more historically legible member of the pair.

```foma
define OEWLossBeforeI [
    {*w} -> 0 || EnglishStarVocalic _ {*i} .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule removes non-initial \emph{*w} before final unstressed \emph{*i}.

The best witness is *sǣ* ‘sea’. Campbell's discussion of the loss of \emph{*w} before
\emph{*i}, Ringe and Taylor's derivation from earlier \emph{*saiwi-} / \emph{*sawi-}, and Luick's
parallel account all point to the same historical consequence
[@Campbell1959, p. 167, §406; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 257, §6.7.1; @Luick1914, p. 173, §187]. The glide has
to disappear early enough for the preceding vowel to continue into the later
fronted and lengthened outcome. If the glide survives too long, the derivation
retains \emph{*w} and misses *sǣ* ‘sea’. If the rule is moved before
SC020 PGmcFinalZDeletion, the same witness yields *sǣw* ‘sea’ rather than
expected OE *sǣ*. This shows that SC020 PGmcFinalZDeletion must come before
[SC054 OEWLossBeforeI](#rule-OEWLossBeforeI). If the rule is delayed until after
[SC063 OEHighVowelApocope](#rule-OEHighVowelApocope), the same witness again yields [*sǣw*]{.pred}
rather than expected *sǣ*. This places [SC054 OEWLossBeforeI](#rule-OEWLossBeforeI)
before [SC063 OEHighVowelApocope](#rule-OEHighVowelApocope).

This is why the chapter belongs immediately before the broader umlautal
developments discussed in [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut).
The two rules together form a genuine lead-in to that later vowel chapter, but
only the second has a strong lexical and handbook footing of its own.

\newpage

# The Old English i-umlaut and West Saxon palatal diphthongization

## Historical discussion of i-umlaut and West Saxon palatal diphthongization

Luick gives the change its traditional scale:

> Der wichtigste Fall von palataler Beeinflussung … war die Veränderung der
> urenglischen Vokale durch i oder j der Folgesilbe.
>
> [@Luick1914, pp. 166--167, §182]

Campbell gives the most compact classical formulation in English when he writes
that “the process known as i-umlaut or i-mutation operates on practically all
the sounds which it could theoretically affect in OE” [@Campbell1959, p. 69,
§190]. He immediately defines the core conditioning environment as a following
`i` or `j`, and he goes on to trace the consequences across much of the vowel
system, including forms such as *giest* ‘guest’, *giefan* ‘give’, *hierde*
‘shepherd’, and *ieldra* ‘older’ [@Campbell1959, pp. 69--72, §§190--197].

Hogg continues in the same vein: “we come now to a change which is almost as
uncontroversial as it is important” [@Hogg1992, p. 112]. His examples, such as
*bryd* ‘bride’, *trymman* ‘strengthen’, *bedd* ‘bed’, *ciest* ‘chest’, and
*wiersa* ‘worse’, likewise emphasize that the change is a broad redistribution
of vowel quality across the Old English vowel system [@Hogg1992,
pp. 112--114].

The narrower palatal-diphthongal material is described differently. Ringe and
Taylor treat West-Saxon diphthongization after initial palatals as a distinct
process [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 215, §6.5.1], and Fulk is even more explicit about
its chronological delicacy when he calls it “diphthongization by initial
palatal consonants (which precedes front umlaut but not breaking)”
[@Fulk2018, p. 74, §4.13]. Ringe and Taylor’s examples such as *gieldan* ‘pay’,
*scield* ‘shield’, and *scieppan* ‘create’ show that this narrower process is
triggered by already palatal consonants and leads to specifically West-Saxon
diphthongal outputs [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 215--216, §6.5.1].

The sequence of discussion is fairly clear. Luick, Campbell, and Hogg all give
i-umlaut primary importance. Ringe and Taylor and Fulk then help separate that
major change from the narrower West-Saxon diphthongization that stands beside
it. The literature therefore establishes a large, system-wide umlautal change
and a narrower adjoining process affecting words after initial palatals. That
distinction matters because the two processes act in different environments and
produce different lexical consequences.

## SC055. Fronting under i-umlaut (`OEIUmlautFronting`) {#rule-OEIUmlautFronting}

The first component of the implementation handles the broad fronting of vowels
under the influence of following `i` or `j`.

```foma
define OEIUmlautFronting [
    {*a} -> {*æ} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ā} -> {*ǣ} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*e} -> {*i} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*o} -> {*e} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ō} -> {*ē} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*u} -> {*y} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ū} -> {*ȳ} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*á} -> {*æ} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*é} -> {*i} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ó} -> {*e} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ú} -> {*y} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger
];
```

In prose, the rule fronts and raises the relevant simple vowels when a following
`i` or `j` provides the trigger.

Historically, this is the most central part of the umlautal development
described by Luick, Campbell, Hogg, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk. Within the
present implementation it stands after [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) and before the narrower
West-Saxon palatal-diphthongization rule discussed below.

The handbooks describe the same conditioning environment in different ways but
with the same phonological consequence: a following high front vocoid triggers
the fronting of earlier back vowels. That is why forms such as *fylgan*
‘follow’, *gylden* ‘golden’, *wyrm* ‘worm’, and *giest* ‘guest’ can all be
treated inside the same formal rule even though they belong to different lexical
classes [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 222, §6.6.1; @Campbell1959, pp. 69--72,
§§190--191].

The same ordering logic that governs the umlaut complex governs this component.
If the umlautal rule set is moved before [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization), PGmc \emph{*kūi} yields *ċȳ*
‘cows’ rather than expected OE *cȳ*, and \emph{*lúnganjō} yields *lunġen*
‘lungs’ rather than expected OE *lungen*. At the other edge, the later
West-Saxon diphthongization must follow the umlautal rule set: if that later
rule is moved too early, PGmc \emph{*géftiz} yields *ġieft* ‘gift’ rather than
expected OE *ġift*, and \emph{*skáiθiz} yields *sċǣþ* ‘sheath’ rather than
expected *sċēaþ*. This shows that [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization)
must come before [SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting), and that
[SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting) must come before
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization).

As a component rule, it shares the chronology of [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut).

## SC055. Raising under i-umlaut (`OEIUmlautRaising`) {#rule-OEIUmlautRaising}

The second component handles the raising of umlauted `æ` to `e`.

```foma
define OEIUmlautRaising [
    {*æ} -> {*e} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger
];
```

In plain language, this rule takes the fronted low vowel created by the earlier
fronting rule and raises it further where the same umlaut trigger still holds.

Historically, this belongs inside the same broad i-umlaut development. It is
part of the same chronological development and shares the evidence base of
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut).

Like the fronting component, this raising rule falls between
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) and
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization). If the umlaut complex is moved before
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization), \emph{*kūi} yields [*ċȳ*]{.pred}
instead of expected *cȳ* and \emph{*lúnganjō} yields [*lunġen*]{.pred} instead of
expected *lungen*. If the later West-Saxon diphthongization is moved too early,
\emph{*géftiz} yields [*ġieft*]{.pred} rather than expected *ġift*, and \emph{*skáiθiz}
yields [*sċǣþ*]{.pred} rather than expected *sċēaþ*.

These outcomes show that [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization)
must come before [SC055 OEIUmlautRaising](#rule-OEIUmlautRaising), and that
[SC055 OEIUmlautRaising](#rule-OEIUmlautRaising) must come before
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization).

This narrower subrule matters because the sources do not describe umlaut as
simple fronting alone. Campbell explicitly notes that the low front vowel
changes again before `m` and `n` in most dialects [@Campbell1959, p. 69, §190],
and Hogg likewise treats short front vowels as part of the same assimilatory
system [@Hogg1992, p. 112].

## SC055. Diphthongal outcomes under i-umlaut (`OEIUmlautDiphthong`) {#rule-OEIUmlautDiphthong}

The third component handles the diphthongal outcomes that also undergo
i-umlaut.

```foma
define OEIUmlautDiphthong [
    {*ea} -> {*ie} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ēa} -> {*īe} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*io} -> {*ie} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*īo} -> {*īe} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*eo} -> {*ie} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ēo} -> {*īe} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*éa} -> {*íe} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*éo} -> {*íe} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger,
    {*ío} -> {*íe} || _ EnglishIUmlautIntervening EnglishIUmlautTrigger
];
```

In prose, the rule states that diphthongal inputs are subject to umlaut as well:
the vowel change is not confined to simple vowels.

This matters historically because the handbooks describe i-umlaut as a
system-wide assimilatory development. The rule therefore stands inside the same
chronological bracket as [SC055 OEIUmlautFronting](#rule-OEIUmlautFronting) and
[SC055 OEIUmlautRaising](#rule-OEIUmlautRaising), even though its outputs are
shaped differently.

The relevant examples are the recurring West-Saxon `ie` forms cited in the
handbooks, including *giest* ‘guest’, *giefan* ‘give’, and *hierde*
‘shepherd’ in Campbell and *ciest* ‘chest’ in Hogg
[@Campbell1959, pp. 69--72, 78--80, §§190--191, 248--251; @Hogg1992,
pp. 112--114]. The present formalization keeps those diphthongal outcomes
visible as a distinct part of the general umlautal development and does not
leave them implicit under the broad description of fronting.

Chronologically, this component also shares the same evidence as the umlaut
complex as a whole. If the umlaut complex is moved before
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization), it
over-palatalizes
\emph{*kūi} and \emph{*lúnganjō}; too-early West-Saxon diphthongization yields
*ġieft* and *sċǣþ* instead of expected *ġift* and *sċēaþ*. The rule therefore
belongs between [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) and
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization). This places
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) before
[SC055 OEIUmlautDiphthong](#rule-OEIUmlautDiphthong), and it places
[SC055 OEIUmlautDiphthong](#rule-OEIUmlautDiphthong) before
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization).

## SC055. The composite i-umlaut rule (`OEIUmlaut`) {#rule-OEIUmlaut}

The implementation also defines a composite rule that composes the three
preceding parts.

```foma
define OEIUmlaut OEIUmlautFronting
    .o. OEIUmlautRaising
    .o. OEIUmlautDiphthong;
```

In prose, this says that the implementation treats the umlaut as a sequence of
fronting, raising, and diphthongal adjustments composed in order.

Chronologically, the composite rule must follow
[SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization). If it is
moved too early, forms such as *cȳ* ‘cows’ and *lungen* ‘lungs’ become
over-palatalized. PGmc \emph{*kūi} yields *ċȳ* ‘cows’; the expected form is
*cȳ* ‘cows’. PGmc \emph{*lúnganjō} yields *lunġen* ‘lungs’; the expected form
is *lungen* ‘lungs’.

The same local network gives the later boundary. If West-Saxon palatal
diphthongization is moved too early, PGmc \emph{*géftiz} yields *ġieft* ‘gift’
rather than expected OE *ġift*, and \emph{*skáiθiz} yields *sċǣþ* ‘sheath’
rather than expected *sċēaþ*. The composite umlaut rule therefore must apply
after [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) and before
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization).

Those failures show that the broad umlautal rule needs an earlier terminus post
quem in the palatalization sequence, even though it remains the main vowel
change within the present chapter.

The composite rule is important because the literature presents the umlaut as a
single historical development even while the implementation decomposes it into
formal parts. The composite definition is the point at which the separate
fronting, raising, and diphthongal effects are treated as one chronological
event in the Old English sequence.

## SC056. West Saxon palatal diphthongization (`OEWsPalatalDiphthongization`) {#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization}

The narrower West-Saxon rule is treated separately from the broader umlautal
complex.

```foma
define OEWsPalatalDiphthongization [
    {*æ} -> {*ea} || .#. [{*ʧ} | {*ʤ} | {*ʃ} | {*j}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant | .#.],
    {*ǣ} -> {*ēa} || .#. [{*ʧ} | {*ʤ} | {*ʃ} | {*j}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant | .#.],
    {*e} -> {*ie} || .#. [{*ʧ} | {*ʤ} | {*ʃ} | {*j}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant | .#.],
    {*ē} -> {*īe} || .#. [{*ʧ} | {*ʤ} | {*ʃ} | {*j}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant | .#.],
    {*é} -> {*íe} || .#. [{*ʧ} | {*ʤ} | {*ʃ} | {*j}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant | .#.],
    {*ḗ} -> {*īe} || .#. [{*ʧ} | {*ʤ} | {*ʃ} | {*j}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant | .#.]
];
```

In prose, this rule diphthongizes certain vowels after already palatal
consonants in West Saxon. It therefore has a narrower dialectal and
chronological scope than the broader umlaut rule.

The historical evidence for that narrower scope is concrete. Ringe and Taylor
illustrate the rule with forms such as *gieldan* ‘pay’, *scield* ‘shield’, and
*scieppan* ‘create’, where an already palatal consonant triggers the diphthongal
outcome [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 215--216, §6.5.1]. Hogg’s *giefan* ‘give’ and
*sceap* ‘sheep’ material belongs to the same phonological zone
[@Hogg1992, pp. 108--109], while Fulk distinguishes this
palatal-consonant-triggered diphthongization from the broad front-mutation
process [@Fulk2018, p. 74, §4.13].

Its place is later than [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut).
If this rule is moved too early, the later ordering is constrained by forms such
as *ġift* ‘gift’ and *sċēaþ* ‘sheath’. PGmc \emph{*géftiz} then yields
*ġieft* ‘gift’; the expected form is *ġift* ‘gift’. PGmc \emph{*skáiθiz}
yields *sċǣþ* ‘sheath’; the expected form is *sċēaþ* ‘sheath’.

This shows that [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) must come before
[SC056 OEWsPalatalDiphthongization](#rule-OEWsPalatalDiphthongization). No
comparably sharp later boundary is available.

No tested lexical item provides a comparably precise later terminus ante quem.
The available evidence therefore establishes the rule’s relation to the earlier
umlautal process much more clearly than it fixes a later point by which it must
already have applied.

The two rules should accordingly be kept distinct. The broad umlautal rule
accounts for a system-wide assimilatory change; the West-Saxon rule accounts for
a narrower palatal-consonant-conditioned diphthongization whose chronological
and dialectal scope is more restricted.

\newpage

# J-cluster coalescence

## Historical discussion

This chapter belongs to the later part of the palatalization and fronting
region. Campbell, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all discuss the same neighborhood
of palatalized and fronted outcomes that underlies forms such as *bīeġan*
‘bend’ and *sēċan* ‘seek’ [@Campbell1959, pp. 89, 107--108, §§170, 248--251;
@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 213--251, §§6.4.1, 6.5.1, 6.6.1--6.6.4; @Fulk2018, pp. 65, 75, §§4.7, 4.13]. None
of them turns this later cluster adjustment into a major independent headline.
The historical interest lies in the fact that it remains a real part of the
sequence even though the larger palatalization and umlaut chapters carry more of
the explanatory weight.

That narrower scale matters. Earlier chapters have already established the plain
velar and \emph{*sk} palatalizations, and the umlaut chapter has already handled the
major vowel consequences. The present rule is a later coalescence inside that
same neighborhood. It deserves explicit prose because the lexical outcomes are
clear, not because it eclipses the larger processes around it.

## SC057. Coalescence of velar + \emph{*j} clusters (`OEJClusterCoalescence`) {#rule-OEJClusterCoalescence}

The implementation keeps the later cluster coalescence very small and explicit.

```foma
define OEJClusterCoalescence (
    [{*g} {*j} -> {*ʤ}]
    .o. [{*k} {*j} -> {*ʧ}]
);
```

In prose, the rule coalesces \emph{*gj} and \emph{*kj} into the palatal outcomes that later
surface in forms such as *bīeġan* ‘bend’ and *sēċan* ‘seek’.

Its earlier dependency is clearer than its later limit. If the rule is moved
before [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization),
the developments behind *bīeġan* ‘bend’ and *sēċan* ‘seek’ are lost. Related forms such as *fylġan* ‘follow’,
*heċġ* ‘hedge’, and *sengan* ‘singe’ fail in the same broader palatalization
zone. PGmc `*báugijaną` yields *bēaġan* ‘bend’ rather than expected OE *bīeġan*,
and PGmc `*sōkijaną` yields *sōċan* ‘seek’ rather than expected *sēċan*. This
shows that [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) must come
before [SC057 OEJClusterCoalescence](#rule-OEJClusterCoalescence). No comparably sharp later lexical
breakpoint emerges within the remaining sequence, so the chronology remains
short and one-sided.

That modest shape is historically appropriate. The rule is a real later member
of the palatalization region, but it does not need to absorb the umlautal
chapter behind it or the nasal-dissimilation chapter that follows it. The
later coalescence remains visible in the sequence once the
larger neighboring chapters are already in place.

\newpage

# Nasal dissimilation

## Historical discussion

Luick preserves individual outcomes such as *enetre* ‘yearling’ (with the
spelling *enitre* in his text) without isolating a separate law around them
[@Luick1914, p. 166]. Campbell likewise reaches forms such as *heofon* ‘heaven’
in a discussion of suffixal variation and does not set them off in any special
section on nasal dissimilation [@Campbell1959, p. 155]. Hogg mentions *heofon*
‘heaven’ in the course of his account of back mutation, again without isolating
a separate law [@Hogg1992, p. 112].

Fulk supplies the clearest general formulation: “In the cluster mn, the first
consonant tends to lose its nasality by dissimilation, though the results are
hardly regular” [@Fulk2018, p. 121, §6.11]. Ringe and Taylor stay close to the
lexical evidence and note that *enetre* ‘yearling’ reflects “loss of the second
\emph{*n} by dissimilation” [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 282].

The discussion therefore develops from scattered lexical observations to a more
explicit but still cautious generalization. Luick preserves the kind of form the
rule is meant to capture. Campbell and Hogg show that related outcomes enter the
handbooks, but only incidentally, as part of larger accounts of other changes.
Fulk makes the recurrent `mn` tendency explicit, while Ringe and Taylor provide
an exact lexical case in *enetre* ‘yearling’. What emerges is a limited but
recurring dissimilatory pattern whose scope is far smaller than that of the
major Old English vowel laws.

## SC058. Nasal dissimilation in short-vowel environments (`OENasalDissimilation`) {#rule-OENasalDissimilation}

The implementation formalizes the change as a narrow rule applying in short
vowel environments before a following `n`.

```foma
define OENasalDissimilation [
    {*m} -> {*f} || EnglishStarShortVowel _ EnglishStarShortVowel {*n} [EnglishStarShortVowel | .#.]
];
```

In plain language, the rule turns medial `m` into `f` in a restricted
short-vowel environment before a following syllable containing `n`.

Historically, the rule captures the limited type of dissimilation reflected in
forms such as *heofon* ‘heaven’, *fæstenn* ‘fasting’, and *enetre* ‘yearling’.
It is much narrower than the major vowel changes and is best understood as a
recurring but partly lexicalized pattern.

The relation between the sources and the formalization is correspondingly close
but not exact. Fulk formulates the tendency at the level of `mn` clusters and
illustrates it with *heofon* ‘heaven’ and *fæstenn* ‘fasting’
[@Fulk2018, p. 121, §6.11]. Ringe and Taylor show the same kind of development
in *enetre* ‘yearling’ [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 282]. Campbell’s “heofon is for
older hefzen” and Hogg’s sequence \emph{*hefon > heofon} preserve outcomes
of the same kind as those modeled here [@Campbell1959, p. 155;
@Hogg1992, p. 112]. The formal rule is therefore narrower than the total set of
handbook remarks: it models one plausible recurrent environment and does not
claim to exhaust every dissimilatory development involving nasals.

Chronologically, the available tests do not identify a sharper position within
the Old English sequence. When the rule is moved earlier, no lexical breakpoint
appears before the inherited West-Germanic material that precedes the tested Old
English changes. When it is moved later, the tests likewise fail to identify a
more precise later boundary within the remainder of the Old English sequence.

No comparable pair of lexical failures fixes a narrower slot here. The present
evidence therefore gives neither a precise terminus post quem nor a precise
terminus ante quem for the rule within the tested sequence. No exact wrong early
or late output is currently available for this chapter.

Even so, the rule has real interpretative consequences. It provides a place in
the implementation for outcomes of the *heofon* ‘heaven’, *fæstenn* ‘fasting’,
and *enetre* ‘yearling’ type discussed in the literature [@Fulk2018, p. 121,
§6.11; @RingeTaylor2014, p. 282; @Campbell1959, p. 155; @Luick1914, p. 166;
@Hogg1992, p. 112]. Without an explicit rule, those outcomes would be left to
diffuse analogy or to unexplained exception lists.

The evidence points to a narrow dissimilatory tendency, especially in `mn`-type
clusters and a small group of lexical outcomes. There is no support for a
regular change operating across a broad phonological field. The rule is secure
enough to model, but the available tests leave its position within the Old
English sequence underdetermined.

# Back mutation

## Historical discussion

Back mutation is the substantive center of this part of the sequence. Campbell treats
it as a later Old English diphthongizing development before following back
vowels, and his examples already show why forms such as *heofon* ‘heaven’ are
historically legible outcomes in their own right
[@Campbell1959, p. 86, §207]. Hogg treats the same development as a later change with
clear parallels to breaking [@Hogg1992, p. 112]. Ringe and Taylor sharpen the
picture by distinguishing West Saxon forms such as *giefan* ‘give’ and *wefan*
‘weave’ from non-West-Saxon forms such as *geofad* and *weofan*
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 319, §6.9.4]. Fulk likewise treats back mutation as a distinct
historical phenomenon with its own profile beside the earlier umlautal
changes [@Fulk2018, p. 69, §4.8].

That makes back mutation different from the short notes that follow it. Back
mutation belongs to the same local stretch of the sequence, but it carries more
historical weight and clearer lexical consequences. Even so, its later relation
lies beyond this immediate stretch of the sequence, and the later weak-tail
region is best kept as a forward reference only.

## SC059. Back mutation before labials and liquids (`OEBackMutation`) {#rule-OEBackMutation}

The implementation keeps the change as one explicit rule.

```foma
define OEBackMutation [
    {*e} -> {*eo} || _ [EnglishStarLabial | EnglishStarLiquid] {*u},
    {*æ} -> {*ea} || _ [EnglishStarLabial | EnglishStarLiquid] EnglishBackMutationTrigger,
    {*é} -> {*éo} || _ [EnglishStarLabial | EnglishStarLiquid] {*u}
];
```

In prose, the rule backs and diphthongizes earlier front vowels before a
following labial or liquid plus a back-vocalic trigger.

Its chronology is real on both sides, but not equally local. The earlier side is
already fixed by the preceding vowel and weak-tail material. If the rule is
moved too early, forms such as \emph{*gébaną} produce *ġeofan* ‘give’; the
expected form is *ġiefan* ‘give’. \emph{*stélaną} likewise produces *steolan*
‘steal’; the expected form is *stelan* ‘steal’. The later side is different. If
the rule is pushed too far to the right, \emph{*wébaną} yields *weofan*
‘weave’; the expected form is *wefan* ‘weave’.
That later edge is real, but it points beyond the present stretch of the sequence into the
later weak-tail reductions, so here it should remain only a forward reference.

These lexical failures show that [SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization) must come before
[SC059 OEBackMutation](#rule-OEBackMutation) and that
[SC059 OEBackMutation](#rule-OEBackMutation) must come before
[SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction).

This is why the change can serve as the center here without implying that the
following weak-tail notes belong to the same historical law. The rule
marks a real local seam, but the section after it immediately becomes narrower.

\newpage

# West Saxon palatal umlaut

## Historical discussion

The evidence is narrow enough that the discussion can stay brief. Campbell and Ringe and Taylor both support the
development behind forms such as *miht* ‘might’ and *niht* ‘night’, while Fulk's
broader chronology makes clear that this material belongs beside the umlaut and
palatal-vowel region as a subordinate note beside it
[@Campbell1959, pp. 107--108, §§248--251; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 215--251, §§6.5.1, 6.6.1--6.6.4;
@Fulk2018, pp. 65, 75, §§4.7, 4.13].

That is why the note belongs here after back mutation even though its clearest
historical tie still reaches back to the earlier umlautal chapter. The
phenomenon is real, yet its place in the sequence is one-sided. The evidence is
clear enough to state and narrow enough to remain brief.

## SC060. West Saxon palatal umlaut before \emph{*h}-clusters (`OEWsPalatalUmlaut`) {#rule-OEWsPalatalUmlaut}

The implementation treats the West Saxon change as one explicit rule.

```foma
define OEWsPalatalUmlaut [
    {*eo} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster .#.,
    {*io} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster .#.,
    {*ie} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster .#.,
    {*eo} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*io} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*ie} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*éo} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster .#.,
    {*ío} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster .#.,
    {*íe} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster .#.,
    {*éo} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*ío} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster EnglishStarFrontVowel,
    {*íe} -> {*i} || _ OEHCluster EnglishStarFrontVowel
];
```

In prose, the rule reduces short diphthongs to \emph{*i} before the relevant \emph{*h}
clusters.

The crucial point is its earlier dependency. The rule must follow
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut), because if it is moved too early
the forms behind *miht* ‘might’ and *niht* ‘night’ remain at the overdeveloped
stage *mieht* and *nieht* rather than expected OE *miht* and *niht*. No comparably sharp later lexical breakpoint emerges
within the remainder of the section. The note therefore belongs here as a short
afterpiece to the umlaut chapter, not as the start of a new larger unit.

This shows that [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) must come before
[SC060 OEWsPalatalUmlaut](#rule-OEWsPalatalUmlaut). No comparably sharp later
boundary is available.

\newpage

# Weak-tail nasal loss

## Historical discussion

The development belongs to the narrower end of the later weak-tail sequence. It is historically
legible through the pathway that leads to *dōn* ‘do’, and the broader late
weak-tail setting is supported by the usual handbook discussions of apocope and
related reduction [@Campbell1959, pp. 144--145, §§345--349; @Hogg1992, pp. 120--121;
@Fulk2018, p. 91, §5.6]. But the decisive lexical tie lies much farther back in the
sequence, in the older development of \emph{*dōną}. That keeps the note real,
while also keeping it small.

Within this later run of changes it follows back mutation and West Saxon
palatal umlaut, but the evidence remains slighter than theirs.

## SC061. Reduction of final nasal weak-tail endings (`OEWeakTailNasalLoss`) {#rule-OEWeakTailNasalLoss}

The implementation keeps the change as one short rule.

```foma
define OEWeakTailNasalLoss [
    {*n} {*ą} -> {*n} || _ .#.,
    {*m} {*ą} -> {*m} || _ .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule reduces final weak-tail endings of the type \emph{*-ną} and
\emph{*-mą} to plain final \emph{*-n} and \emph{*-m}.

The clearest lexical witness is the pathway to *dōn* ‘do’. If the rule is moved
too early, before the older reduction that already shapes the \emph{*dōną}
sequence,
the derivation records no output instead of expected OE *dōn* ‘do’. No equally
sharp later breakpoint appears within the tested sequence. That is why the note remains
one-sided and why its earlier relation should be understood as a distant
cross-reference only and should not reshape the broader sequence.

This shows that SC023 NWGmcNStemNLoss must come before
[SC061 OEWeakTailNasalLoss](#rule-OEWeakTailNasalLoss). No comparably sharp later
boundary is available.

The development is best treated as a small late weak-tail adjustment. It remains
visible in the sequence because it affects the pathway to *dōn* ‘do’, but the
evidence does not support treating it as the center of a wider historical
development.

\newpage

# High-vowel apocope

## Historical discussion

By this point in the sequence the main palatal and umlautal changes are already in place, but weak-tail reduction is not finished. Final high vowels still survive in many forms until a late apocope removes them after heavy syllables and in the relevant trisyllabic patterns. Campbell, Hogg, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all describe this as a real Old English development, even when they differ over how much of the surrounding syncope material should be grouped with it [@Campbell1959, pp. 144--145, §§345--349; @Hogg1992, p. 120; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 284--303, §§6.8.1, 6.8.4; @Fulk2018, p. 91, §5.6].

The rule matters because it makes many familiar Old English forms look abruptly shorter than their earlier stages. It is also a good place to show how finite-state chronology works. The derivation can say exactly which forms fail if apocope is moved too early or too late, so the late weak-tail sequence becomes visible through concrete lexical breakpoints and explicit ordering statements.

## SC063. High-vowel apocope after heavy syllables and in trisyllables (`OEHighVowelApocope`) {#rule-OEHighVowelApocope}

The implementation keeps the whole apocope system in one explicit rule.

```foma
define OEHighVowelApocope [
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*u} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,

    {*ų} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongDiphthong OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortDiphthong OEAnyConsonant OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*u} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortDiphthong OEAnyConsonant OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,

    {*ų} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortDiphthong OEAnyConsonant EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*u} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*ų} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant OEAnyConsonant+ EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*u} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant OEAnyConsonant+ EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*ų} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant OEAnyConsonant+ EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ .#.,
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongVowel _ .#.,
    {*u} -> 0 || {*x} _ .#.,
    {*ų} -> 0 || {*x} _ .#.,
    {*i} -> 0 || {*x} _ .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule deletes final \emph{*i}, \emph{*u}, and \emph{*ų} when the preceding structure is heavy enough, or when a trisyllabic form behaves as equivalent to a heavy environment. The longer code box makes visible how many separate environments the transducer has to distinguish in order to realize what the handbooks describe more compactly.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut), PGmc \emph{*kūi} yields [*cū*]{.pred} rather than
expected OE *cȳ* ‘cow’, and PGmc \emph{*brūdiz} yields [*brūd*]{.pred} rather than
expected OE *brȳd* ‘bride’. If the rule is delayed until after
[SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening), PGmc \emph{*fúrxtīnaz} yields [*fyrht*]{.pred}
rather than expected OE *fyrhte* ‘fright’. This means that
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) must come before
[SC063 OEHighVowelApocope](#rule-OEHighVowelApocope), and that
[SC063 OEHighVowelApocope](#rule-OEHighVowelApocope) must come before
[SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening).

That placement is historically apt. The rule must come late enough for umlautal effects to have already been created, but it is not the last weak-tail event in the language. Apocope removes a major set of final high vowels, yet later weak-tail reductions still remain.

\newpage

# Post-apocope \emph{*n}-loss and medial syncope

## Historical discussion of post-apocope \emph{*n}-loss and medial syncope

After high-vowel apocope the weak tail is still not entirely settled. Hogg, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all describe a late region in which further medial reduction and cluster pressure remain active, even though the evidence is much less even than it was for the main apocope rule [@Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 264--303, §§6.7.3--6.8.4; @Fulk2018, p. 91, §5.6]. The inherited \emph{*furht-} family adds one especially narrow witness of its own, because it shows that a single surviving nasal can still decide whether the weak-tail output is right or wrong [@Kroonen2013, p. 201].

This chapter is therefore intentionally modest. One rule has real positive chronology on both sides, but only through a single witness family. The other belongs naturally to the same late region without yet producing a comparably sharp first-break result. Keeping both visible makes the weak-tail aftermath more honest than either silence or overstatement would.

## SC064. Loss of stem-final \emph{*n} after long \emph{*ī} (`NWGmcInStemNLoss`) {#rule-NWGmcInStemNLoss}

The first rule is extremely narrow in form.

```foma
define NWGmcInStemNLoss [{*n} -> 0 || {*ī} _ .#.];
```

In prose, it removes a final \emph{*n} after long \emph{*ī}. That looks tiny on the page, but the effect is real in the inherited family behind *fyrhte* ‘fright’.

The chronology is two-sided even though the witness base is not broad. If the
rule is moved before [SC041 PWGmcFinalBareALoss](#rule-PWGmcFinalBareALoss), PGmc \emph{*fúrxtīnaz} yields
[*fyrhten*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *fyrhte* ‘fright’. If the rule is delayed
until after [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening), the same PGmc form again
yields [*fyrhten*]{.pred} rather than expected *fyrhte*. This shows that
[SC041 PWGmcFinalBareALoss](#rule-PWGmcFinalBareALoss) must come before
[SC064 NWGmcInStemNLoss](#rule-NWGmcInStemNLoss), and it places
[SC064 NWGmcInStemNLoss](#rule-NWGmcInStemNLoss) before
[SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening).

That symmetry does not make the rule large. Both boundaries are carried by the same witness family, so the evidence is real but narrow. The value of the rule lies in showing that even a very small formal step can still have a concrete lexical place in the chronology.

## SC065. Medial syncope before dentals after heavy syllables (`OEMedialSyncope`) {#rule-OEMedialSyncope}

The second rule formalizes one narrower slice of late medial syncope.

```foma
define OEMedialSyncope [
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ [{*θ}|{*ð}|{*d}|{*t}],
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongDiphthong OEAnyConsonant+ _ [{*θ}|{*ð}|{*d}|{*t}],
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant OEAnyConsonant+ _ [{*θ}|{*ð}|{*d}|{*t}]
];
```

In prose, it deletes medial \emph{*i} before a following dental after a heavy syllable. The broader historical background is secure enough, since the handbooks do treat late medial syncope as part of the same weak-tail region [@Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 264--303, §§6.7.3--6.8.4; @Fulk2018, p. 91, §5.6].

The finite-state chronology is much weaker, however. If the rule is moved earlier, the current tests find no real break before the search reaches bundled earlier material. If the rule is delayed, the tests likewise find no real break before the current search boundary. No exact wrong early or late output is currently available, so this section remains boundary-limited and does not claim a sharper relation than the evidence supports.

That limitation is worth stating plainly. Late medial syncope belongs in the history of the weak tail, but this particular rule does not yet fix an earlier boundary or a later boundary of its own.

\newpage

# Late syncope and degemination

## Historical discussion of late syncope and degemination

Once later medial syncope begins to bite, the language inherits new consonant clusters that do not always remain stable. Hogg and Ringe and Taylor both describe this connection between vowel loss and later consonant simplification, while Brunner's discussion of *netle* ‘nettle’ beside later *netele* keeps the syncope evidence tied to a concrete lexical type [@Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 264--296, §§6.7.3--6.8.2; @SieversBrunner1965, pp. 144--145, §§158--159]. Fulk is especially useful for the larger timing, because he places this syncope after i-umlaut [@Fulk2018, p. 91, §5.6].

The resulting chapter has an uneven center of gravity. Syncope itself is well motivated, one downstream degemination rule has a clear lexical breakpoint, and the dental assimilation step between them is plausible without yet being independently well anchored. That imbalance is part of the point. The sequence shows how the transducer can make a narrow chain of consequences explicit without pretending that every member has the same evidential weight.

## SC066. L-adjacent syncope in medial syllables (`OELAdjacentSyncope`) {#rule-OELAdjacentSyncope}

The syncope rule is stated directly.

```foma
define OELAdjacentSyncope [
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ {*l},
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarLongVowel OEAnyConsonant+ _ {*l},
    {*i} -> 0 || EnglishStarDiphthong OEAnyConsonant+ _ {*l}
];
```

In prose, it deletes medial \emph{*i} before \emph{*l}, creating forms such as *netle* ‘nettle’ and *spinl* ‘spindle’.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut), PGmc \emph{*nátilōn} yields *nætle* rather
than expected OE *netle* ‘nettle’, and PGmc \emph{*spénnilō} yields [*spenl*]{.pred}
rather than expected *spinl* ‘spindle’. If the rule is delayed until after
[SC068 OEPreconsonantalDegemination](#rule-OEPreconsonantalDegemination), PGmc \emph{*spénnilō} yields [*spinnl*]{.pred} rather than expected *spinl*. This shows that
[SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) must come before
[SC066 OELAdjacentSyncope](#rule-OELAdjacentSyncope), and that
[SC066 OELAdjacentSyncope](#rule-OELAdjacentSyncope) must come before
[SC068 OEPreconsonantalDegemination](#rule-OEPreconsonantalDegemination).

The rule is therefore stronger than a mere descriptive convenience. It has concrete lexical witnesses, and those witnesses show that the syncope must stand after umlaut but before later cluster simplification.

## SC067. Dental assimilation in newly formed clusters (`OEDentalAssimilation`) {#rule-OEDentalAssimilation}

The dental repair step is formally very short.

```foma
define OEDentalAssimilation [
    {*θ} -> 0 || {*t} _
];
```

In prose, it removes \emph{*θ} after \emph{*t} when syncope has created an over-heavy dental cluster. That kind of cluster simplification is historically plausible as part of the same late sequence that follows syncope [@Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 279--296, §§6.7.5, 6.8.2].

The chronology tests, however, do not yet isolate a positive earlier boundary or a positive later boundary for this rule. If the rule is moved earlier, the search reaches bundled earlier material without a real break. If it is delayed, the search likewise reaches the current search boundary without a real break. No exact wrong early or late output is currently available, so the section remains boundary-limited.

That makes the rule best read as a narrow intermediate step inside the late syncope sequence. It is useful in the derivation, but the present evidence does not justify treating it as a stronger chronology anchor than it is.

## SC068. Preconsonantal degemination before sonorants (`OEPreconsonantalDegemination`) {#rule-OEPreconsonantalDegemination}

The final degemination rule is written as one composed definition.

```foma
define OEPreconsonantalDegemination OEPreconsonantalDegemTT .o. OEPreconsonantalDegemNN;
```

In prose, it simplifies doubled \emph{*tt} or \emph{*nn} before a following sonorant. The historical logic is straightforward enough. Once syncope has created a cluster such as the one behind *spinl* ‘spindle’, the doubled consonant does not remain [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 279--296, §§6.7.5, 6.8.2].

Its positive evidence is one-sided but exact. If the rule is moved before
[SC066 OELAdjacentSyncope](#rule-OELAdjacentSyncope), PGmc \emph{*spénnilō}
yields [*spinnl*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *spinl* ‘spindle’. No later real break
is currently available before the current search boundary. This places
[SC066 OELAdjacentSyncope](#rule-OELAdjacentSyncope) before
[SC068 OEPreconsonantalDegemination](#rule-OEPreconsonantalDegemination),
while the later side remains one-sided.

That one-sided profile is still meaningful. The rule is clearly later than the syncope that creates the offending cluster, but the current evidence does not yet force a sharper later boundary beyond that.

\newpage

# Early o-shortening

## Historical discussion

By the time the sequence reaches this point, the language has already undergone the larger palatal and umlautal reorganizations to the left. What now comes into view is a later weak-tail region in which unstressed vowels are shortened, fronted, merged, and in some forms lost altogether. Campbell's discussion of early shortening of unaccented long vowels helps place this material in the larger history, while Hogg, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all describe the same late region through the intertwined history of apocope, syncope, shortening, and later reductions [@Campbell1959, p. 148, §355; @Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 298--314, §§6.8.3--6.9.3; @Fulk2018, pp. 90--96, §§5.6--5.7].

Early o-shortening belongs at the opening of that region, but it is not its strongest hinge. The evidence is broader and more distant than it is for the rules that follow, especially [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) and [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening). The rule therefore works best as an opening note that makes the chronology legible without pretending that the whole late weak tail begins and ends here.

## SC069. Early shortening of unstressed \emph{*ō} before nasals (`OEEarlyOShortening`) {#rule-OEEarlyOShortening}

The implementation isolates the early shortening step as one rule.

```foma
define OEEarlyOShortening [
    {*ō} -> {*a} || EnglishStarVocalic [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]+ _ EnglishStarNasal
];
```

In prose, the rule shortens unstressed long \emph{*ō} before a following nasal. Because this shortening happens early, the resulting \emph{*a} can still participate in the later fronting and merger that shape many weak final syllables.

Its chronology is real, but it is broad and one-sided. If the rule is moved before SC023 NWGmcNStemNLoss, PGmc \emph{*nḗdrōn} yields [*nǣdran*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *nǣdre* ‘adder’, PGmc \emph{*érθōn} yields [*eorþan*]{.pred} rather than expected *eorþe* ‘earth’, and PGmc \emph{*fláskōn} yields [*flascan*]{.pred} rather than expected *flasce* ‘flask’. The same earlier shift also disrupts forms such as *heorte* ‘heart’ and *līne* ‘line’. This broad set of failures shows that SC023 NWGmcNStemNLoss must come before [SC069 OEEarlyOShortening](#rule-OEEarlyOShortening).

No equally sharp later breakpoint appears within the tested range. The current search reaches its later boundary without a real break, so the rule should not be given a spurious later limit. Early o-shortening is therefore best read as an opening adjustment in the late weak tail, not as the central chronology seam of the region.

\newpage

# Early unstressed fronting and later o-shortening

## Historical discussion of early unstressed fronting and later o-shortening

The next pair forms a clearer local hinge. Campbell's account of shortening of unaccented long vowels is still relevant here, but the real value of the pair lies in the way the finite-state derivation separates an earlier fronting stage from a later shortening stage. Hogg, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all place these developments inside the same late weak-tail region in which shortening, syncope, and final-vowel adjustment continue to interact [@Campbell1959, p. 148, §355; @Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 298--314, §§6.8.3--6.9.3; @Fulk2018, pp. 90--96, §§5.6--5.7].

The hierarchy inside the pair is not flat. [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) is the stronger hinge because it has an earlier and a later lexical breakpoint. [SC071 OELateOShortening](#rule-OELateOShortening) confirms the same seam from the right, but its later side remains open within the tested range. That imbalance is historically useful: it shows how the late weak tail is held together by small but concrete lexical breakpoints, not by one single undifferentiated rule.

## SC070. Early fronting of unstressed \emph{*a} (`OEUnstressedFrontingEarly`) {#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly}

The implementation gives the early fronting stage its own named step.

```foma
define OEUnstressedFrontingEarly OEUnstressedAFronting;
```

In prose, the rule fronts unstressed \emph{*a} to \emph{*æ} at the point where the earlier shortening has already created a frontable vowel, but the later shortening of unstressed \emph{*ō} has not yet happened. This is the step that makes endings such as OE \emph{-en} possible in forms like *lungen* ‘lungs’.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization), PGmc \emph{*lúnganjō} yields [*lunġen*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *lungen* ‘lungs’. If the rule is delayed until after [SC071 OELateOShortening](#rule-OELateOShortening), PGmc \emph{*búrōθi} yields [*boreþ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *boraþ* ‘bears’, and PGmc \emph{*mḗnōθz} yields [*mōneþ*]{.pred} rather than expected *mōnaþ* ‘month’. This shows that [SC052 OEVelarPalatalization](#rule-OEVelarPalatalization) must come before [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly), and that [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) must come before [SC071 OELateOShortening](#rule-OELateOShortening).

That two-sided pattern is why [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) serves as the real hinge of the pair. The earlier side is narrow, but the later side produces a coherent set of wrong unstressed vowels across several verbal and nominal endings.

## SC071. Later shortening of unstressed \emph{*ō} (`OELateOShortening`) {#rule-OELateOShortening}

The following rule handles the later shortening stage.

```foma
define OELateOShortening [
    {*ō} -> {*a} || EnglishStarVocalic [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]+ _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]*
];
```

In prose, the rule shortens the remaining unstressed long \emph{*ō} after the earlier fronting stage has already done its work. This is the stage that leaves the later “stable a” endings behind forms such as OE *boraþ* ‘bears’ and *liornaþ* ‘learns’.

Its earlier boundary is the reciprocal side of the [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) relation. If the rule is moved before [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly), PGmc \emph{*búrōθi} yields [*boreþ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *boraþ*, and PGmc \emph{*líznōθi} yields [*liorneþ*]{.pred} rather than expected *liornaþ*. No equally sharp later breakpoint appears within the tested range, so the available evidence shows only that [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) must come before [SC071 OELateOShortening](#rule-OELateOShortening).

This one-sided profile is appropriate to the chapter. [SC071 OELateOShortening](#rule-OELateOShortening) is a real follower in the same pair, but it does not need to carry more chronology than the evidence supports.

# Unstressed long-vowel shortening and ae-merger

## Historical discussion of unstressed long-vowel shortening and ae-merger

This pair is the strongest internal seam in the late weak tail. Campbell's discussion of shortening of unaccented long vowels gives the classical background, while Ringe and Taylor place shortening of unstressed long vowels among the last prehistoric Old English changes and then carry the story forward into the immediately following developments [@Campbell1959, p. 148, §355; @Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 298--314, §§6.8.3--6.9.3; @Fulk2018, pp. 90--96, §§5.6--5.7]. What the finite-state derivation adds is a very sharp distinction between the shortening itself and the later merger of unstressed \emph{*æ} with \emph{*e}.

That is why this chapter can be more substantial than the opening note or the earlier pair. [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) and [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger) have a real reciprocal relation in the cards, and the chapter can show both sides of it directly. The pair also keeps its outward relations in view: [SC064 NWGmcInStemNLoss](#rule-NWGmcInStemNLoss) remains the earlier prerequisite for shortening, while [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) remains the later outward handoff from the merger.

## SC072. Shortening of unstressed long vowels (`OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening`) {#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening}

The implementation keeps the shortening stage as one composed rule.

```foma
define OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening1
    .o. OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening2
    .o. OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening3
    .o. OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening5
    .o. OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening6
    .o. OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening7
    .o. OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening8;
```

In prose, the rule shortens the remaining unstressed long vowels before the weak final outcomes settle into their later forms. The broad effect is visible in many weak endings, but the chronology can still be pinned down by a few particularly clear witnesses.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC064 NWGmcInStemNLoss](#rule-NWGmcInStemNLoss), PGmc \emph{*fúrxtīnaz} yields [*fyrhten*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *fyrhte* ‘fright’. If the rule is delayed until after [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger), PGmc \emph{*nḗdrōn} yields [*nǣdræ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *nǣdre* ‘adder’, and PGmc \emph{*fádēr} yields [*fædær*]{.pred} rather than expected *fæder* ‘father’. This shows that [SC064 NWGmcInStemNLoss](#rule-NWGmcInStemNLoss) must come before [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening), and that [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) must come before [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger).

That two-sided relation makes [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) the historical center of the pair. It still depends on earlier weak-tail preparation to the left, but within the local chapter it is the shortening stage that creates the strongest seam.

## SC073. Merger of unstressed \emph{*æ} with \emph{*e} (`OEUnstressedAEMerger`) {#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger}

The following rule handles the merger stage.

```foma
define OEUnstressedAEMerger OEWeakTailReduction3;
```

In prose, the rule merges unstressed \emph{*æ} with \emph{*e} after shortening has already produced the vulnerable weak final vowels. This is the stage that turns a broad set of final outcomes toward the ordinary OE \emph{-e} spellings.

Its earlier and later relations are both concrete. If the rule is moved before [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening), PGmc \emph{*nḗdrōn} yields [*nǣdræ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *nǣdre*, and PGmc \emph{*fádēr} yields [*fædær*]{.pred} rather than expected *fæder*. If the rule is delayed until after [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss), PGmc \emph{*táixōn} yields [*tāæ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *tā* ‘toe’. This means that [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) must come before [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger), and that [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger) must come before [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss).

The earlier side is broader than the later side, but both are real. That is why this pair works as the strongest local core in the late weak tail. Shortening and merger are adjacent, reciprocal, and still open to meaningful outward cross-reference without having to absorb later material into the chapter.

\newpage

# Medial unstressed-i lowering

## Historical discussion of medial unstressed-i lowering and \emph{*ng} retention

The next pair belongs to the same late weak-tail region as the shortening and merger chapter to the left, but it is smaller and more locally conditioned. Hogg and Ringe and Taylor both treat the late weakening and merger of unstressed vowels as part of a continuing history, and that background helps explain why the present chapter reads best as a narrow follow-on, not a new center of gravity [@Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 327--332, §§6.9.5--6.9.6]. The specific value of the pair is derivational. [SC074 OEMedUnstressedILowering1](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1) generalizes a medial unstressed-\emph{i} lowering, while [SC075 OEMedUnstressedILowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering) immediately narrows that result by preserving \emph{i} before \emph{*ng} in words of the *sċilling* ‘shilling’ type.

That close interaction is why the two rules still belong in one small chapter. The history is not simply adjacency in the cascade. The second rule directly repairs the overbroad outcome that the first would otherwise leave behind in the \emph{*ng} environment. Even so, the pair remains narrower and more witness-limited than [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) and [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger).

## SC074. First medial unstressed-\emph{i} lowering (`OEMedUnstressedILowering1`) {#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1}

The implementation gives the first lowering step its own rule.

```foma
define OEMedUnstressedILowering1 [
    {*i} -> {*e} || EnglishStarVocalic [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]+ _
];
```

In prose, the rule lowers medial unstressed \emph{*i} to \emph{*e} after a preceding vocalic syllable. This is the broader step that would spread the \emph{e}-outcome through the late weak tail if it were left uncorrected.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening), PGmc \emph{*fúrxtīnaz} yields [*fyrhti*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *fyrhte* ‘fright’. If it is delayed until after [SC075 OEMedUnstressedILowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering), PGmc \emph{*skíllingaz} yields [*sċilleng*]{.pred} rather than expected *sċilling* ‘shilling’. This shows that [SC072 OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening](#rule-OEUnstressedLongVowelShortening) must come before [SC074 OEMedUnstressedILowering1](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1), and that [SC074 OEMedUnstressedILowering1](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1) must come before [SC075 OEMedUnstressedILowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering).

The evidence is narrow on each side, but it is still real. The rule belongs between the stronger shortening/merger chapter and the more specific \emph{*ng} preservation that follows it.

## SC075. Preservation of medial unstressed \emph{*i} before \emph{*ng} (`OEMedUnstressedILowering`) {#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering}

The following rule gives the local \emph{*ng} restriction its own explicit step.

```foma
define OEMedUnstressedILowering [
    {*e} -> {*i} || _ {*n} {*g}
];
```

In prose, the rule restores \emph{*i} before \emph{*ng}, preventing the broader lowering from producing the wrong medial vowel in forms such as *sċilling* ‘shilling’.

Its earlier boundary is the reciprocal side of the [SC074 OEMedUnstressedILowering1](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1) relation. If the rule is moved before [SC074 OEMedUnstressedILowering1](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1), PGmc \emph{*skíllingaz} yields [*sċilleng*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *sċilling*. No equally sharp later breakpoint appears within the tested range, so the available evidence shows only that [SC074 OEMedUnstressedILowering1](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering1) must come before [SC075 OEMedUnstressedILowering](#rule-OEMedUnstressedILowering).

That one-sided profile is enough for a follower rule of this kind. It is historically useful because it keeps the \emph{*ng} forms from being swallowed by the broader lowering, but it does not need to carry more chronology than the evidence supplies.

\newpage

# Prefix i-reduction

## Historical discussion

Late weak-tail reduction does not affect only inflectional endings and medial vowels. Unstressed prefixes also weaken, and that smaller development deserves a visible place in the sequence even though its chronology is much less sharply fixed. Fulk is the clearest source here, since his discussion of vowels in prefixes makes forms like OE \emph{*be-} and \emph{*ne-} historically legible outcomes in their own right [@Fulk2018, p. 97, §5.7]. Hogg and Ringe and Taylor supply the broader late environment in which such weakening belongs, even though they do not isolate this rule as a major center of the late-tail history [@Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 298--332, §§6.8.3--6.9.6].

That is enough for a short note, but not for a major chronology anchor. Prefix reduction belongs in the late weak tail, yet the current tests do not recover a positive earlier boundary or a positive later boundary for this specific rule.

## SC076. Reduction of prefixal \emph{*i} in unstressed position (`OEPrefixIReduction`) {#rule-OEPrefixIReduction}

The implementation keeps the prefixal reduction as one rule.

```foma
define OEPrefixIReduction [
    {*i} -> {*ĕ} || .#. [{*b} | {*n}] _ [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant] EnglishStarVocalic
];
```

In prose, the rule reduces unstressed prefixal \emph{*i} to a weaker vowel in the \emph{bi-} and \emph{ni-} type prefixes before a consonant plus a following vowel. This is the development that helps make later prefix spellings such as OE \emph{*be-} and \emph{*ne-} historically intelligible.

The chronology evidence is boundary-limited on both sides. If the rule is moved earlier, the current tests do not find a real lexical break before the search reaches bundled earlier material. If the rule is delayed, they do not find a real lexical break before the tested range ends at [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis). No exact wrong early or late output is currently available, so the prose does not claim a sharper ordering relation than the evidence supports.

That modest result is still useful. The rule has historical legitimacy from the prefix-vowel literature, but its place in the sequence remains a bounded methodological note, not a positive lexical hinge.

\newpage

# Weak-tail reduction

## Historical discussion

The last rule in the present late weak-tail cluster is stronger than the small prefix note that precedes it. Campbell, Hogg, Ringe and Taylor, and Fulk all support a late region in which apocope, shortening, contraction, and further weak-tail reductions continue to reshape final syllables [@Campbell1959, p. 148, §355; @Hogg1992, pp. 120--121; @RingeTaylor2014, pp. 298--314, §§6.8.3--6.9.3; @Fulk2018, pp. 90--91, §5.6]. What makes the present rule stand out is that the finite-state chronology gives it a real boundary on both sides.

That does not make it a license to absorb later material. The later relation to [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction) is meaningful, but it remains a cross-reference to the next cluster, not a reason to pull that cluster into the present chapter.

## SC078. Reduction of remaining weak-tail vowels (`OEWeakTailReduction`) {#rule-OEWeakTailReduction}

The implementation keeps the last weak-tail reduction as one explicit step.

```foma
define OEWeakTailReduction OEWeakTailReduction1;
```

In prose, the rule carries the remaining weak-tail reductions that prevent a broad class of spurious \emph{-en} or extra-vowel outcomes from surviving too late in the derivation.

Its chronology is real on both sides, though the two sides are not equally local. If the rule is moved before [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly), PGmc \emph{*bákaną} yields [*bacen*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *bacan* ‘bake’, and PGmc \emph{*bíndaną} yields [*binden*]{.pred} rather than expected *bindan* ‘bind’, alongside a much wider set of comparable \emph{-en} failures. If the rule is delayed until after [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction), PGmc \emph{*fléuxaną} yields [*flēoan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *flēon* ‘flee’, and PGmc \emph{*sláxaną} yields [*sleaan*]{.pred} rather than expected *slēan* ‘slay’. This shows that [SC070 OEUnstressedFrontingEarly](#rule-OEUnstressedFrontingEarly) must come before [SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction), and that [SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction) must come before [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction).

The asymmetry of those two boundaries is important. The earlier side is broad and should be read as a large computational limit, not a tight local adjacency claim. The later side is narrower and more directly interpretable. Together they make [SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction) substantial enough for its own chapter, but still not a reason to merge the next cluster into the present section.

\newpage

# Final-j loss and final geminate simplification

## Historical discussion of final-j loss and final geminate simplification

The first closing pair belongs to the late verbal and weak-tail region that follows [SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction), but it is not yet the strongest center of the closing cluster. Its coherence comes from a genuine derivational interaction. Once [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy) removes \emph{*j} after the relevant heavy environments, forms such as *lungen* ‘lungs’ can end up with an unwanted final geminate that [SC080 OEFinalGeminateSimplification](#rule-OEFinalGeminateSimplification) immediately removes. That interaction is close enough to justify one shared historical discussion.

The hierarchy inside the pair is still uneven. The heavier historical load lies on [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy), whose broad earlier relation reaches back to [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut), while [SC080 OEFinalGeminateSimplification](#rule-OEFinalGeminateSimplification) is the narrower follower that resolves the final \emph{nn} outcome in one sharply diagnostic derivation. The chapter therefore remains compact and explicit.

## SC079. Loss of \emph{*j} after heavy syllables (`OEJLossAfterHeavy`) {#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy}

The implementation gives the \emph{*j}-loss step its own rule.

```foma
define OEJLossAfterHeavy [
    {*j} -> 0 || (EnglishStarLongVowel | EnglishStarDiphthong) [EnglishStarConsonantNoR | EnglishPalatalConsonant] _,
    {*j} -> 0 || EnglishStarShortVowel [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant] [EnglishStarConsonantNoR | EnglishPalatalConsonant] _
];
```

In prose, the rule removes \emph{*j} after the relevant heavy-syllable configurations. This is the step that lets a broad set of late verbal forms move beyond earlier umlaut-sensitive vocalism.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut), PGmc \emph{*galáubijaną} yields [*ġelēafan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *ġelīefan* ‘believe’, PGmc \emph{*báugijaną} yields [*bēaġan*]{.pred} rather than expected *bīeġan* ‘bow’, and PGmc \emph{*fúlgijaną} yields [*fulġan*]{.pred} rather than expected *fylġan* ‘follow’. If it is delayed until after [SC080 OEFinalGeminateSimplification](#rule-OEFinalGeminateSimplification), PGmc \emph{*lúnganjō} yields [*lungenn*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *lungen* ‘lungs’. This shows that [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) must come before [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy), and that [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy) must come before [SC080 OEFinalGeminateSimplification](#rule-OEFinalGeminateSimplification).

The left side is broad, but the right side is sharply local. Together they explain why [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy) is the stronger member of the pair.

## SC080. Simplification of final geminates (`OEFinalGeminateSimplification`) {#rule-OEFinalGeminateSimplification}

The following rule handles the final simplification directly.

```foma
define OEFinalGeminateSimplification [
    {*n} -> 0 || {*n} _ .#.
];
```

In prose, the rule removes the extra final nasal in forms where the preceding derivation has already created a final geminate.

Its earlier boundary is the reciprocal side of the [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy) relation. If the rule is moved before [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy), PGmc \emph{*lúnganjō} yields [*lungenn*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *lungen*. No later real break appears within the tested range before [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis), so the available evidence shows only that [SC079 OEJLossAfterHeavy](#rule-OEJLossAfterHeavy) must come before [SC080 OEFinalGeminateSimplification](#rule-OEFinalGeminateSimplification).

That is enough for a follower rule of this kind. It is historically useful because it prevents the unwanted final geminate from surviving, but it does not need to carry more chronology than the evidence supplies.

\newpage

# J-strengthening, vocalization, and ei-contraction

## Historical discussion of j-strengthening, vocalization, and ei-contraction

The middle closing sequence is technically tighter than the opening pair, but it is also more internally uneven. Its real center is [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization). [SC081 OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong](#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong) prepares the consonantal stage that the later vocalization must not erase too early, and [SC083 OEUnstressedEIContraction](#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction) then removes the extra \emph{ei}-like sequence that would otherwise survive too long in the resulting weak verbal endings.

That hierarchy is historically meaningful. The three rules form one local chain because the output of each immediately conditions the next, but the chain is not flat. [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization) is the strongest member because it has the clearest local evidence on both sides, while [SC081 OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong](#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong) is the broad earlier flank and [SC083 OEUnstressedEIContraction](#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction) is the one-sided follower on the right.

## SC081. Strengthening of \emph{*j} after front diphthongs (`OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong`) {#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong}

The implementation keeps the strengthening step as one explicit rule.

```foma
define OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong [
    {*j} -> {*ʒ} || [{*ēa}|{*ḗa}|{*íe}|{*īe}|{*éa}] _ EnglishStarVocalic
];
```

In prose, the rule keeps \emph{*j} as a strengthened consonantal outcome after the relevant front diphthongs and so prevents too-early vocalization.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut), PGmc \emph{*stráwjaną} yields [*strēaġan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *strīeġan* ‘strew’. If it is delayed until after [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization), the same PGmc form yields [*strīeian*]{.pred} rather than *strīeġan*. This shows that [SC055 OEIUmlaut](#rule-OEIUmlaut) must come before [SC081 OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong](#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong), and that [SC081 OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong](#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong) must come before [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization).

The left side is broad and far, but the right side is a sharp local seam in the *strīeġan* derivation.

## SC082. Intervocalic vocalization of \emph{*j} (`OEIntervocalicJVocalization`) {#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization}

The implementation then turns the consonantal \emph{*j} into a vocalic outcome between vowels.

```foma
define OEIntervocalicJVocalization [
    {*j} -> {*i} || EnglishStarVocalic _ EnglishStarVocalic
];
```

In prose, the rule vocalizes intervocalic \emph{*j} to \emph{*i}. This is the step that creates the extra \emph{ei}-like sequence later removed by [SC083 OEUnstressedEIContraction](#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction) in many weak verb forms.

Its chronology is concrete on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC081 OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong](#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong), PGmc \emph{*stráwjaną} yields [*strīeian*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *strīeġan* ‘strew’. If it is delayed until after [SC083 OEUnstressedEIContraction](#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction), PGmc \emph{*búrōjaną} yields [*boreian*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *borian* ‘bore’, PGmc \emph{*xándlōjaną} yields [*handleian*]{.pred} rather than expected *handlian* ‘handle’, and PGmc \emph{*mákōjaną} yields [*maceian*]{.pred} rather than expected *macian* ‘make’. This shows that [SC081 OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong](#rule-OEJStrengtheningAfterFrontDiphthong) must come before [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization), and that [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization) must come before [SC083 OEUnstressedEIContraction](#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction).

That two-sided local seam is why [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization) is the center of the three-rule chain.

## SC083. Contraction of unstressed \emph{ei} (`OEUnstressedEIContraction`) {#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction}

The final rule removes the extra unstressed \emph{e} before \emph{i}.

```foma
define OEUnstressedEIContraction [
    {*e} -> 0 || EnglishStarVocalic [EnglishStarConsonant | EnglishPalatalConsonant]+ _ {*i}
];
```

In prose, the rule contracts the unstressed \emph{ei}-like sequence that the preceding vocalization would otherwise leave behind in forms such as *borian* ‘bore’ and *liccian* ‘lick’.

Its earlier boundary is the reciprocal side of the [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization) relation. If the rule is moved before [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization), PGmc \emph{*búrōjaną} yields [*boreian*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *borian*, PGmc \emph{*líznōjaną} yields [*liorneian*]{.pred} rather than expected *liornian*, and PGmc \emph{*líkkōjaną} yields [*licceian*]{.pred} rather than expected *liccian*. No later real break appears within the tested range before [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis), so the available evidence shows only that [SC082 OEIntervocalicJVocalization](#rule-OEIntervocalicJVocalization) must come before [SC083 OEUnstressedEIContraction](#rule-OEUnstressedEIContraction).

That one-sided profile is appropriate to the right follower in this chain. The rule is historically real, but it does not need to carry a stronger later boundary than the evidence provides.

\newpage

# H-loss and contraction

## Historical discussion of h-loss and contraction

This adjacent pair is the clearest compact core in the closing cluster. The interaction is direct. Once [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) removes intervocalic \emph{*h}, the derivation is left with hiatus that [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction) immediately resolves. That derivational dependence is exactly the kind of close interaction that justifies one shared historical discussion.

The pair is also stronger and more book-legible than the more technical three-rule chain to its left. Ringe and Taylor give the clearest modern account of the late sequence of \emph{h}-loss and contraction [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 305--314, §§6.9.1--6.9.3]. Fulk's discussion of contracted verbs places the same outcomes into a broader Germanic context [@Fulk2018, p. 270, §12.21], and Luick's treatment of West Germanic contractions gives older grammatical support for the same family of outcomes [@Luick1914, p. 165].

## SC085. Loss of intervocalic \emph{*h} (`OEHLoss`) {#rule-OEHLoss}

The implementation keeps the consonant loss as one explicit rule.

```foma
define OEHLoss [
    {*x} -> 0 || EnglishStarVocalic _ EnglishStarVocalic
];
```

In prose, the rule removes intervocalic \emph{*h}, creating the hiatus that later contraction must resolve.

Its chronology is explicit on both sides. If the rule is moved before [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger), PGmc \emph{*táixōn} yields [*tāæ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *tā* ‘toe’. If it is delayed until after [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction), PGmc \emph{*fléuxaną} yields [*flēoan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *flēon* ‘flee’, PGmc \emph{*sláxaną} yields [*sleaan*]{.pred} rather than expected *slēan* ‘slay’, PGmc \emph{*téxun} yields [*teoon*]{.pred} rather than expected *tēon* ‘draw’, and PGmc \emph{*táixōn} yields [*tāe*]{.pred} rather than expected *tā*. This shows that [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger) must come before [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss), and that [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) must come before [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction).

The earlier side is narrow, but the later side is a tight four-row reciprocal seam that clearly feeds the following contraction rule.

## SC086. Contraction of the resulting hiatus (`OEContraction`) {#rule-OEContraction}

The following rule contracts the hiatus left by [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss).

```foma
define OEContraction [
    {*a} {*a} -> {*ā},
    {*e} {*e} -> {*ē},
    {*i} {*i} -> {*ī},
    {*o} {*o} -> {*ō},
    {*u} {*u} -> {*ū},
    {*ea} {*a} -> {*ēa},
    {*ēa} {*a} -> {*ēa},
    {*eo} {*a} -> {*ēo},
    {*ēo} {*a} -> {*ēo},
    {*eo} {*o} -> {*ēo},
    {*ēo} {*o} -> {*ēo},
    {*éo} {*o} -> {*ḗo},
    {*ḗo} {*o} -> {*ḗo},
    {*ā} {*a} -> {*ā},
    {*ā} {*e} -> {*ā},
    {*ē} {*a} -> {*ē},
    {*ē} {*e} -> {*ē},
    {*ḗ} {*a} -> {*ḗ},
    {*ḗ} {*e} -> {*ḗ},
    {*ī} {*a} -> {*ī},
    {*ī} {*e} -> {*ī},
    {*ḯ} {*a} -> {*ḯ},
    {*ḯ} {*e} -> {*ḯ},
    {*ō} {*a} -> {*ō},
    {*ō} {*e} -> {*ō},
    {*ū} {*a} -> {*ū},
    {*ū} {*e} -> {*ū}
];
```

In prose, the rule contracts the vowel sequences created after \emph{h}-loss. This is the step that turns over-long transitional forms into outcomes such as *flēon* ‘flee’, *slēan* ‘slay’, and *tēon* ‘draw’.

Its earlier boundary is the reciprocal side of the [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) relation. If the rule is moved before [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss), PGmc \emph{*fléuxaną} yields [*flēoan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *flēon*, PGmc \emph{*sláxaną} yields [*sleaan*]{.pred} rather than expected *slēan*, PGmc \emph{*téxun} yields [*teoon*]{.pred} rather than expected *tēon*, and PGmc \emph{*táixōn} yields [*tāe*]{.pred} rather than expected *tā*. No later real break appears within the tested range before [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis), so the available evidence shows only that [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) must come before [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction).

That one-sided profile is still substantial because the earlier reciprocal seam is so clear. The already visible [SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction) relation also points here, but it remains a cross-reference, not a reason to absorb [SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction) into the same chapter.

# R-metathesis

## Historical discussion

R-metathesis closes the present sequence, but it does not behave like the second half of a tidy local pair. The historical process is real enough to deserve explicit prose, yet its chronology is broad and distant on the left and open on the right. Sievers-Brunner gives a clear page-safe grammatical statement of the phenomenon through forms such as *berstan* ‘burst’, *forst* ‘frost’, and *cærse* ‘cress’ [@SieversBrunner1965, p. 159, §179]. Luick likewise treats metathesis as a later rearrangement whose interaction with breaking remains variable and not tightly local [@Luick1914, p. 201].

That is why the chapter stays short. The note belongs after the contraction chapter in the assembled order, but the evidence does not justify inventing a positive claim that [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction) must come before [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis) simply because the two are adjacent.

## SC087. Metathesis of \emph{*r} with a following short vowel (`OERMetathesis`) {#rule-OERMetathesis}

The implementation states the metathesis directly.

```foma
define OERMetathesis [
    {*r} {*e} -> {*e} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*u} -> {*u} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*i} -> {*i} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*o} -> {*o} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*a} -> {*a} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*é} -> {*é} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*ó} -> {*ó} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*á} -> {*á} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t}
];
```

In prose, the rule moves \emph{*r} across a following short vowel in the relevant late clusters, producing forms such as *berstan* ‘burst’ where an earlier order would still show a broken vowel sequence.

Its chronology is one-sided and broad. If the rule is moved before [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking), PGmc \emph{*bréstaną} yields [*beorstan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *berstan* ‘burst’. That shows that [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) must come before [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis). The later side is different: the current tests find no real break beyond the current order before the search limit, so the available evidence does not identify any later historical boundary for [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis).

That profile is exactly why the chapter remains modest. The earlier relation is historically real, but it is broad and far away. The right side remains boundary-limited. R-metathesis therefore works best as a short closing note, not as the capstone of a tighter adjacent pair.
