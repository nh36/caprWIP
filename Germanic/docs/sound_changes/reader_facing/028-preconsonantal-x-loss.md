# Simplification of the cluster \emph{*xs} before a consonant

## Historical discussion

The change treated here is narrow. When \emph{*x} stood before \emph{*s} and
that \emph{*s} was itself followed by a further consonant, the \emph{*x} was
lost and the cluster was reduced. Campbell states the rule in exactly these
terms, that when a consonant follows, \emph{*xs} becomes *s*, and he illustrates
it with *wæstm* ‘growth’ and *wæsma* beside *weaxan* ‘to grow’, and with
Northumbrian *sesta* ‘sixth’ beside West Saxon *siexta*
[@Campbell1959, p. 170, §417]. Brunner gives the same statement and adds that
the following consonant may be *j* as well as a true obstruent, citing
*nēosian* ‘to visit’, *þīsl* ‘pole’, *wæsma* and *wæstm*
[@SieversBrunner1965, p. 184, §221.2]. Bülbring formulates it as a pre-English
change and is careful to say that it held as a rule, with exceptions
[@Bulbring1902, p. 215, §527].

The cluster that the change requires is a specific one, and two neighbouring
clusters show that the restriction is real. Where \emph{*xs} stood with no
consonant after it, the \emph{*x} was not lost at all. It survived long enough
to cause breaking and then hardened to the sound written *x*, that is [ks], as
in *fox* ‘fox’, *siex* ‘six’, *weaxan*, *oxa* ‘ox’ and *fleax* ‘flax’
[@Campbell1959, p. 170, §416]. Where \emph{*x} stood before a single consonant
it was likewise kept. Campbell observes that once \emph{*xs} had become [ks],
the only group in which \emph{*x} still stood before a voiceless consonant in
earliest Old English was \emph{*xt}, and that this group remained, as in
*feohtan* ‘to fight’, *miht* ‘might’, *niht* ‘night’ and *sōhte* ‘sought’
[@Campbell1959, p. 186, §464]. The contrast is attested outside English as
well. Old High German and Old Saxon *lastar* ‘reproach’ comes from
\emph{*laxstra-} with the \emph{*x} lost before \emph{*st}, while Old English
*leahtor* comes from \emph{*laxtra-} with the \emph{*x} kept before \emph{*t}
[@Campbell1959, p. 170, §417].

The change is not Proto-Germanic. Gothic keeps the \emph{*h} of this cluster in
*bi-niuhsjan* ‘to spy out’ and *saihsta* ‘sixth’, so the loss must be later than
the separation of Gothic [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 157--158]. Campbell reports the
loss from the whole West Germanic area and from North Germanic as well, citing
Old Norse *ísl* ‘axle’ and *nýsa*, Old Saxon *weslon* ‘to exchange’, *wastum*
‘growth’ and *niustan*, and Old High German *niusen* ‘to try’
[@Campbell1959, p. 170, §417]. Ringe and Taylor set out the same comparative
material and reach a more guarded conclusion. They derive Proto-Germanic
\emph{*niuhsijaną} through Proto-West Germanic \emph{*niusjan} to Old English
*nēosan*, and \emph{*sehstō} to Northumbrian *sesta*, and they take the Old
Saxon agreement in *wastum*, *thisla* and *niusian* to show a shared northern
West Germanic change. Against that they weigh the competition between *þixl*
and *þīsl* in early Mercian, the survival of \emph{*x} in *eaxl* ‘shoulder’ from
\emph{*ahslu}, and the retention in Old High German *sehsto* and *dihsala*.
Their conclusion is that the \emph{*h} was lost, possibly variably and possibly
only in some dialects, when two or more consonants followed, and that the loss
may have been in part a parallel development in the diverging Northwest Germanic
dialects [@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 157--158]. The existence of the change is
therefore secure while its exact date and extent are not, and the rating given
here reflects that division.

Two chronological anchors are available. Ringe and Taylor place the loss after
the Proto-West Germanic syncope of \emph{*-CijV-}, since it is that syncope
which brings the \emph{*s} and the \emph{*j} of \emph{*niuhsjan} together
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 157]. They place it before breaking, observing that the
undiphthongized vowels of *wæstm* and *þīsl* can be accounted for only by
supposing that these \emph{*h} were lost before breaking took place
[@RingeTaylor2014, p. 158]. The rule is stated between those two points.

One witness in this collection undergoes the change. Proto-Germanic
\emph{*funxstiz} ‘fist’ reaches the rule as \emph{*fū́xstiz}, the long vowel
having been produced by the Proto-Germanic loss of a nasal before \emph{*x}
described in [SC103 PGmcNasalLossBeforeX](#rule-PGmcNasalLossBeforeX). The
cluster \emph{*xst} is then reduced to \emph{*st}, and the word continues to Old
English *fȳst* ‘fist’. The comparative set for this particular word is West
Germanic throughout, with Old Frisian *fēst*, Old Saxon and Old High German
*fūst*, Dutch *vuist* and German *Faust*
[@Kroonen2013, p. 160; @Orel2003, p. 157]. Neither Gothic nor Old Norse
preserves a reflex of it, so the word bears on the domain of the change rather
than on its date.

The word *thought* is the control. Proto-Germanic \emph{*θánxtē} also passes
through [SC103 PGmcNasalLossBeforeX](#rule-PGmcNasalLossBeforeX), which leaves
\emph{*θą̄xtē}, but the \emph{*x} there stands before a single \emph{*t} and not
before \emph{*s}, so the present rule does not touch it and Old English has
*þōhte* ‘thought’ with its *h* intact. The pair *fist* and *thought* reproduces
within this collection the same contrast that *lastar* and *leahtor* show across
the West Germanic languages.

The relation between the two rules should not be overstated. The earlier rule
does supply the cluster that this one simplifies, but the order of the two is
established by their stages and not by any word in this collection. If the
present rule were stated first, *fist* would still reach *fȳst*, because
removing the \emph{*x} from \emph{*funxstiz} leaves a nasal before *s*, and that
nasal is removed with compensatory lengthening by the North Sea Germanic
nasal-spirant law. The outcome is overdetermined, and the chronology rests on
Gothic *bi-niuhsjan* and *saihsta* instead.

## SC028. Simplification of \emph{*xs} before a consonant (`PNWGmcPreconsonantalXLoss`) {#rule-PNWGmcPreconsonantalXLoss}

```foma
define PNWGmcPreconsonantalXLoss [
    {*x} -> 0 || _ {*s} EnglishStarConsonant
];
```

The \emph{*s} in the structural description carries the whole weight of the
rule. Without it the rule would delete \emph{*x} before any two consonants, and
it would then wrongly remove the first element of a geminate \emph{*xx} before
\emph{*j}, where Old English in fact has *hliehhan* ‘to laugh’ with the geminate
written *hh* [@Campbell1959, p. 186, §464]. The rule fires on *fist* and on no
other word in this collection, and it leaves *fox*, *six*, *wax*, *flax* and
*ox* untouched, as it must, along with *thought*, *fight*, *night*, *light*,
*might*, *knight*, *fright* and *wight*.

The implementation name retains an older description of the rule and will be
brought into line in a separate pass.
