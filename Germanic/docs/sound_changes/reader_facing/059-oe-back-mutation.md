# Back mutation

## Historical discussion

West Saxon *giefan* ‘give’ and *wefan* ‘weave’ stand against non-West-Saxon
*geofad* 'gave' and *weofan* 'weave'. Ringe and Taylor use this contrast to define the
dialectal profile of back mutation [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 319, §6.9.4].
Campbell's treatment of diphthongization before following back vowels includes
*heofon* ‘heaven’ [@Campbell1959, p. 86, §207], while Hogg draws the instructive
comparison with breaking [@Hogg1992, p. 112]. Fulk accordingly separates back
mutation from the earlier umlautal changes [@Fulk2018, p. 69, §4.8].

## SC059. Back mutation before labials and liquids (`OEBackMutation`) {#rule-OEBackMutation}

```foma
define OEBackMutation [
    {*e} -> {*eo} || _ [EnglishStarLabial | EnglishStarLiquid] {*u},
    {*æ} -> {*ea} || _ [EnglishStarLabial | EnglishStarLiquid] EnglishBackMutationTrigger,
    {*é} -> {*éo} || _ [EnglishStarLabial | EnglishStarLiquid] {*u}
];
```

Three witness forms bracket the chronology. If back mutation precedes
[SC048 OESecondaryNasalization](#rule-OESecondaryNasalization), forms such as
\emph{*gébaną} produce *ġeofan* ‘give’; the
expected form is *ġiefan* ‘give’. \emph{*stélaną} likewise produces *steolan*
‘steal’; the expected form is *stelan* ‘steal’. At the other edge, delaying
back mutation until after
[SC078 OEWeakTailReduction](#rule-OEWeakTailReduction) makes
\emph{*wébaną} yield *weofan* ‘weave’; the expected form is *wefan* ‘weave’.
Thus back mutation follows secondary nasalization but precedes the weak-tail
reductions.
