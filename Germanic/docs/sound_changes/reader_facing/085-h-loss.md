# Intervocalic h-loss

## Historical discussion

When [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) removes intervocalic \emph{*h}, it creates
hiatus. [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction) immediately resolves the
resulting vowel sequence.

Ringe and Taylor describe this late sequence of \emph{h}-loss and contraction
[@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 305--314, §§6.9.1--6.9.3]. Fulk places the contracted
verbs in a broader Germanic context [@Fulk2018, p. 270, §12.21], and Luick
describes the corresponding West Germanic contractions [@Luick1914, p. 165].

## SC085. Loss of intervocalic \emph{*h} (`OEHLoss`) {#rule-OEHLoss}

```foma
define OEHLoss [
    {*x} -> 0 || EnglishStarVocalic _ EnglishStarVocalic
];
```

The rule removes intervocalic \emph{*h}, creating the hiatus that later contraction must resolve.

If the rule is moved before [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger), PGmc [táixōn]{.recon} ‘toe’ yields [*tāæ*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *tā* ‘toe’. If it is delayed until after [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction), PGmc [fléuxaną]{.recon} ‘flee’ yields [*flēoan*]{.pred} rather than expected OE *flēon* ‘flee’, PGmc [sláxaną]{.recon} ‘slay’ yields [*sleaan*]{.pred} rather than expected *slēan* ‘slay’, PGmc [téxun]{.recon} ‘draw’ yields [*teoon*]{.pred} rather than expected *tēon* ‘draw’, and PGmc [táixōn]{.recon} yields [*tāe*]{.pred} rather than expected *tā*. These outputs require [SC085 OEHLoss](#rule-OEHLoss) to follow [SC073 OEUnstressedAEMerger](#rule-OEUnstressedAEMerger) and precede [SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction).

The earlier boundary rests on one witness; the four later witnesses establish
the immediate relation to contraction.
