# Chapter 2. From Proto-Northwest Germanic to Proto-West Germanic

## Historical interval

This chapter covers the sound changes that took place in the proto-language shared
by the West Germanic languages — Old English, Old Frisian, Old Saxon, Old High
German, and Old Dutch — before the individual languages diverged. The starting
reconstruction is Proto-Northwest Germanic (PNWGmc), the hypothetical common
ancestor of North Germanic and West Germanic together; the ending reconstruction
is Proto-West Germanic (PWGmc), the immediate common ancestor of the West Germanic
languages specifically.

## Scope and internal diversity

Changes in this chapter are not all equally pan-West-Germanic in scope. They
may be grouped broadly as follows:

Northwest Germanic innovations (shared by both North and West Germanic):
innovations in the unstressed vowel system, certain final-syllable vowel changes,
and selected consonant cluster simplifications. Changes labelled `NWGmc` in the
CAPR rule names fall here, though rule prefixes are not always reliable guides to
historical scope.

Proto-West-Germanic innovations (shared within West Germanic but not in
North Germanic): the cluster of morphological and phonological changes that
distinguish Old English, Old High German, Old Saxon, and Old Frisian from Old
Norse. Changes labelled `PWGmc` in the CAPR rule names generally fall here.
They include early apocope rules, certain consonant assimilations, and the
West Germanic gemination of consonants before `*j`.

## Major changes

The chapter opens with the root-noun nominative `*-z` loss (SC096), the
generalization of endingless nominatives through the athematic consonant
stems, complete before Proto-West Germanic: none of the West Germanic
daughters shows any ending in this class [@RingeTaylor2014, p. 118]. It is
the earliest of the three historically distinct final-`*z` developments; the
other two (SC020 and SC097) belong to Chapter 3.

The `*ai` monophthongization (SC004) represents one of the most pervasive
shared NW–West Germanic vowel shifts, turning unstressed endings such as the
dative singular and strong-adjective plural to longer vowels. Ringe and Taylor
treat this as one of the clearest post-PNWGmc shared developments
[@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 40--41]; Fulk groups it among the North/West-Germanic
shared innovations that distinguish the period from Gothic [@Fulk2018, §5.2].

The West Germanic consonant changes of this chapter — j-gemination (SC010),
early i-apocope (SC006), coronal-w assimilation (SC008), and related rules —
represent the most productive phonological territory for the CAPR derivations.
They feed a large proportion of the distinctive consonant clusters of Old
English. Handbooks vary in exactly how they group and name these changes
[@Campbell1959, §§ 404, 406; @Hogg1992, §7.1].

The nasal spirant corridor (SC026–SC027) illustrates a type of change common
in historical grammars of the "Ingvaeonic" or "North Sea Germanic" area:
nasals disappear before voiceless fricatives, with compensatory vowel
lengthening [@Campbell1959, §§ 462--463; @Hogg1992, §7.77]. The CAPR model
splits this into two ordered steps to make the vowel effect computationally
tractable; the book prose explains that split against the handbook tradition,
which typically presents the change as a single process.

Several changes in this chapter carry `PWGmc` labels in the CAPR implementation
but appear later in the computational cascade than their historical stage would
suggest: final bare-`*a` loss (SC041), surviving bimoric `*ō` unrounding
(SC042), and Sievers-law syncope (SC050) are placed late in the transducer for
computational reasons. Their chapter assignment here reflects their historical
stage, not their cascade position; the individual sound-change sections note
the divergence.

## A note on source terminology and subgrouping

The literature uses several partly overlapping stage labels for this period:

* Northwest Germanic: the node uniting North and West Germanic.
* Proto-West Germanic: the node uniting only the West Germanic languages.
* North Sea Germanic or Ingvaeonic: a proposed subgroup within West
  Germanic covering Old English, Old Frisian, and Old Saxon (and sometimes Old
  Low Franconian), sharing certain innovations over a broader area.
* Anglo-Frisian: a narrower proposed subgroup linking only Old English
  and Old Frisian.

These labels are not always used consistently across sources. Ringe and Taylor
are cautious about reconstructing a discrete Proto-West-Germanic node
[@RingeTaylor2014, pp. 50--55]. Campbell notes that many of the
"West Germanic" shared features could alternatively be treated as parallel
developments rather than common inheritance [@Campbell1959, §§ 1--5].

CAPR uses `PWGmc` and `NWGmc` as organizing labels for this chapter without
claiming to have settled all questions about West Germanic subgrouping. Changes
that appear in the literature under "Ingvaeonic" labels but affect the Old
English–to-Proto-Germanic derivation chain are treated here as late expressions
of the same West Germanic developmental period unless existing CAPR dossier
research specifically argues for Anglo-Frisian or English-specific placement.

## Rule names

The CAPR rules in this chapter carry names beginning with `NWGmc` or `PWGmc`.
These names are stable internal identifiers. A name beginning with `NWGmc` does
not guarantee that the change is exclusive to Northwest Germanic, and a name
beginning with `PWGmc` does not guarantee that it is absent from North Germanic.
The historical analysis in each sound-change section takes priority over the
name prefix.
