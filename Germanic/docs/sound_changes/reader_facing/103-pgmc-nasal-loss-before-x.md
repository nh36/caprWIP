# Proto-Germanic loss of a nasal before \emph{*x}

## Historical discussion

The oldest change treated in this book is common to the whole family. In the
group [-nx-]{.recon} the nasal consonant was lost, the preceding vowel was
lengthened in compensation, and that lengthened vowel was nasalized. Its results
are shared by every daughter language: Gothic *þeihan*, *brāhta*, *þūhta* stand
beside Old High German *dīhan*, *brāhta*, *fūht* and Old English *þēon* ‘thrive’,
*brōhte* ‘brought’, *þūhte* ‘seemed’, *fūht* ‘damp’
[@Campbell1959, p. 44, §119; @Fulk2018, p. 55, §4.1;
@Ringe2017, pp. 149--150, §3.2.7]. Because no daughter keeps the nasal, the
change belongs to Proto-Germanic itself, and it precedes every Northwest
Germanic, West Germanic, North Sea Germanic and Anglo-Frisian development
described in the chapters that follow.

Only [a]{.recon}, [i]{.recon} and [u]{.recon} occur in this position. Germanic
had already raised [e]{.recon} to [i]{.recon} and [o]{.recon} to [u]{.recon}
before a nasal followed by a consonant, so the mid vowels are absent from the
input [@Fulk2018, p. 55, §4.1].

The vowel that the change creates is long and nasalized, and it is not yet
rounded. Fulk emphasizes that the lengthened vowels remained nasalized for a
considerable time, well past the close of the Northwest Germanic period, since
the nasalized low vowel produced in this way went on to develop to *ō* in
Anglo-Frisian and did not fall together with the Old English *ā* that came from
[ai]{.recon} [@Fulk2018, p. 55, §4.1]. The comparative material makes the same
point directly: Gothic, Old Norse, Old High German and Old Saxon all reflect the
Proto-Germanic nasalized low vowel as unrounded *ā*, and only Old English and
Old Frisian show *ō* [@Campbell1959, p. 44, §119; @Fulk2018, p. 72, §4.11].
Ringe describes Proto-Germanic \emph{*hanhaną} as \emph{*[xą̄xaną]} and observes
that its low vowel was rounded, along with the other nasalized low vowels, in
the northernmost West Germanic dialects [@Ringe2017, pp. 149--150, §3.2.7].
That rounding is a separate and much later change, and it is treated in the
chapter on the rounding of the long nasalized low vowel.

## SC103. Proto-Germanic nasal loss before \*x (`PGmcNasalLossBeforeX`) {#rule-PGmcNasalLossBeforeX}

```foma
define PGmcNasalLossBeforeX [
    {*a} -> {*ą̄} || _ EnglishStarNasal {*x},
    {*i} -> {*ī} || _ EnglishStarNasal {*x},
    {*u} -> {*ū} || _ EnglishStarNasal {*x},
    {*á} -> {*ą̄} || _ EnglishStarNasal {*x},
    {*í} -> {*ī} || _ EnglishStarNasal {*x},
    {*ú} -> {*ū} || _ EnglishStarNasal {*x}
] .o. [
    EnglishStarNasal -> 0 || _ {*x}
];
```

The rule performs the three parts of the change together: it lengthens the
vowel, it marks the lengthened low vowel as nasalized, and it then removes the
conditioning nasal. The low vowel is written [ą̄]{.recon} and the high vowels are
written [ī]{.recon} and [ū]{.recon}, because the nasality of the high vowels has
no further consequence: they go on to develop exactly as the inherited long
[ī]{.recon} and [ū]{.recon} do [@Campbell1959, p. 47, §121]. The nasality of the
low vowel is carried forward because its later fate depends on it.

The single witness in the present corpus is [fúnxstiz]{.recon} ‘fist’, which
becomes [fū́xsti]{.recon} and, after the loss of [x]{.recon} before the cluster
in [SC028 PNWGmcPreconsonantalXLoss](#rule-PNWGmcPreconsonantalXLoss), gives Old
English *fȳst* ‘fist’. The long vowel of Old High German *fūst*, Dutch *vuist*
and German *Faust* shows that the word belongs here and to no later law
[@Kroonen2013, p. 160]. The rule also supplies the [xst]{.recon} cluster on
which the loss of [x]{.recon} before a consonant operates, so the two stand in a
feeding relation.
