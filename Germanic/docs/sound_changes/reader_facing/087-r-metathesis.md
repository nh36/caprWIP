# R-metathesis

## Historical discussion

Sievers-Brunner describes r-metathesis in forms such as *berstan* ‘burst’,
*forst* ‘frost’, and *cærse* ‘cress’
[@SieversBrunner1965, p. 159, §179]. Luick likewise treats it as a later
rearrangement whose interaction with breaking remains variable
[@Luick1914, p. 201].

The evidence establishes that breaking precedes metathesis. It does not
establish an ordering relation between
[SC086 OEContraction](#rule-OEContraction) and
[SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis).

## SC087. Metathesis of \emph{*r} with a following short vowel (`OERMetathesis`) {#rule-OERMetathesis}

```foma
define OERMetathesis [
    {*r} {*e} -> {*e} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*u} -> {*u} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*i} -> {*i} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*o} -> {*o} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*a} -> {*a} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*é} -> {*é} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*ó} -> {*ó} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t},
    {*r} {*á} -> {*á} {*r} || EnglishStarConsonant _ {*s} {*t}
];
```

The rule moves \emph{*r} across a following short vowel in the relevant late clusters, producing forms such as *berstan* ‘burst’ where an earlier order would still show a broken vowel sequence.

Moving the rule before [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking) makes PGmc \emph{*bréstaną} yield *beorstan* rather than expected OE *berstan* ‘burst’. On this evidence, I take [SC087 OERMetathesis](#rule-OERMetathesis) to follow [SC044 OEBreaking](#rule-OEBreaking). Moving it later within the tested sequence alters none of the checked outputs.

The checked forms fix the earlier relation but do not identify a corresponding
later constraint. The sources treat r-metathesis as a late rearrangement after
breaking without placing it immediately beside contraction.
