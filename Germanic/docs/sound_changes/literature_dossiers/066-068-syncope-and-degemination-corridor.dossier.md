## Historical problem

The scaffold groups SC066-SC068 as a late weak-tail / syncope / cluster-cleanup
corridor. That grouping is historically plausible, but it is not automatically a
single handbook chapter.

The core issue is straightforward. After earlier weak-tail reductions,
especially the apocope zone, Old English develops new medial consonant
clusters. Syncope can remove a vowel next to `l`, dental clusters can then
undergo local assimilation, and geminates that now stand before another
consonant may simplify. In CAPR, this logic is represented as three adjacent
rules:

1. `SC066` deletes the medial high vowel in a narrow `...C_i_l...` environment.
2. `SC067` simplifies post-syncope dental clusters by deleting `θ` after `t`.
3. `SC068` degeminates `tt` or `nn` before a following sonorant.

The chronology cards show that the strongest local evidence lies at the edges
of the corridor, not in its middle. `SC066` must follow `SC055` OE I Umlaut and
must precede `SC068` OE Preconsonantal Degemination; `spindle` is the crucial
later-side form. `SC067`, by contrast, is currently boundary-limited both
earlier and later. That already suggests a likely historical distinction:
`SC066` and `SC068` map onto handbook discussions of syncope plus downstream
cluster simplification more readily than `SC067`, which may be better treated as
a local cleanup bridge inside the model.

## Source dossier

### Campbell 1959
- source_key: Campbell1959
- locator: §§345--349; §§388--389
- terminology: apocope; loss of medial vowels after short syllables
- short quotation: "Medial unaccented vowels are very freely dropped after short syllables, when the loss causes a group consisting of consonant + l or r to arise."
- paraphrase: Campbell is useful for the basic Old English distinction between final high-vowel loss and later medial-vowel loss. He separates apocope from medial syncope, then notes that short-syllable syncope is especially common where the result is a new consonant + `l/r` cluster.
- conditioning: final `i/u` loss is weight-sensitive; medial syncope after short syllables is favored when it produces clusters such as `-tl-`, `-tr-`, `-dl-`, `-dr-`
- chronology: apocope and syncope are related but not identical; the syncope material is discussed later than the classical final-vowel-loss sections
- examples: `betra`, `winstre`, `heolstor`; for the apocope/syncope relation `weorod`, `heafodu`, `heafdu`
- cautions: Campbell gives strong support for the general syncope environment, but he does not isolate an `l`-adjacent rule or a separate named rule of preconsonantal degemination.

### Hogg 1992
- source_key: Hogg1992
- locator: pp. 120--121
- terminology: apocope; syncope; assimilation and simplification in consonant groups
- short quotation: "if by syncope a group of three consonants arose ... this was often simplified by the loss of one of the three"
- paraphrase: Hogg is especially good for the structural relation among late weak-vowel loss, syncope, and consonant-cluster cleanup. He treats apocope and syncope as distinct but overlapping late OE processes, and he explicitly notes that cluster simplification often follows when syncope creates an over-heavy consonant group.
- conditioning: high vowels are lost finally by apocope and medially by syncope; newly created three-consonant groups are then simplified
- chronology: syncope follows the earlier umlaut phase and belongs to the later reduction of unstressed vowels
- examples: `heafodu`, `heafod`, `heafdu`; `cwidest > cwist`
- cautions: Hogg's examples are broader than the exact SC066-SC068 corridor. They support the historical logic of syncope plus cleanup, but not necessarily CAPR's exact three-rule segmentation.

### Ringe and Taylor 2014
- source_key: RingeTaylor2014
- locator: §§6.7.3--6.7.5; §§6.8.1--6.8.2
- terminology: general syncope of short vowels; consequences of general syncope; degemination next to another consonant
- short quotation: "geminate consonants were also degeminated next to another consonant"
- paraphrase: Ringe and Taylor provide the clearest staged account for this corridor. They distinguish general syncope from later apocope, give `nettle` as a syncope-type example, and explicitly treat degemination as one of the consequences of syncope-created clusters. Their `spindle` derivation is especially valuable because it shows the kind of preconsonantal geminate simplification that CAPR tracks with `SC068`.
- conditioning: unstressed short vowels in open internal syllables are lost under conditioned weight/stress patterns; downstream consonant clusters may undergo depalatalization, assimilation, and degemination
- chronology: general syncope precedes general apocope; the cluster consequences are then discussed as effects fed by syncope
- examples: `netle ~ netele`; `fetlum`; `spinel`; `cyste`; `brycte`
- cautions: Ringe and Taylor do not present `SC066`, `SC067`, and `SC068` as three named textbook laws. The strongest historical support is for syncope and its consequences as a chain, not for a stable three-part corridor label.

### Luick 1914
- source_key: Luick1914
- locator: §§304--307
- terminology: Schwund von `i/u`; Apokope; Synkope in offener Mittelsilbe
- short quotation: "§ 306. ... schwanden auch i und u in offener Mittelsilbe"
- paraphrase: Luick is especially helpful for the internal sequencing of weak-tail loss. He distinguishes final `i/u` loss from the later loss of `i/u` in open medial syllables and then adds the special trisyllabic cases where competition between middle and final syllables affects the result.
- conditioning: final `i/u` are lost under apocope conditions; medial `i/u` are syncopated in open syllables; trisyllabic words can show competing reductions
- chronology: the final-vowel-loss sections precede the open-middle-syllable syncope sections, and the latter are described as somewhat later
- examples: `demde`, `engles`, `heafdes`, `strengpu`, `heafdu`
- cautions: Luick is best for general late weak-tail chronology, but he is less direct than Ringe and Taylor on the exact `nettle` / `spindle` corridor and does not isolate a separate chapter on degemination.

### Sievers-Brunner 1965
- source_key: SieversBrunner1965
- locator: §§157--159
- terminology: Synkope von Mittelvokalen
- short quotation: "in einigen Fällen (wie netele für netle Nessel) muß es sich um neu entstandene Sekundärvokale handeln"
- paraphrase: Sievers-Brunner is the most directly useful older grammar for the `nettle` type. It distinguishes the general syncope of middle vowels, notes that short-syllable `-i-` syncope is common, and explicitly treats forms like `netele` as later secondary-vowel restorations beside older `netle`.
- conditioning: short medial `-i-` syncopates readily after short syllables except in some blocked consonant environments; later West Saxon can restore a secondary vowel
- chronology: earlier syncopated forms are primary; fuller forms such as `netele` are later analogical or secondary-vowel developments
- examples: `netle`, `fetlum`, `cytele`, `micele`, `hmcla`
- cautions: Sievers-Brunner strongly supports the syncope side of the corridor, but it does not promote a separate handbook rule called "OE Preconsonantal Degemination". That remains a model-facing label for a consequence of cluster formation.

### Fulk 2018
- source_key: Fulk2018
- locator: §5.6
- terminology: later preliterary changes of medial and final vowels
- short quotation: "In Anglo-Frisian this syncope took place later than the application of i-umlaut"
- paraphrase: Fulk is useful mainly as comparative background. He confirms that Anglo-Frisian syncope is later than i-umlaut and that the change does not operate in closed syllables, which supports the left edge of `SC066` and the general late-vowel-reduction setting of the corridor.
- conditioning: syncope after heavy syllables in open syllables; not in closed syllables
- chronology: later than i-umlaut in Anglo-Frisian
- examples: `giest`; `brȳd`; `egesa`; weak preterite material
- cautions: Fulk does not focus on the `l`-adjacent corridor or on `spindle`-type degemination. It is therefore a support source for chronology and comparative setting, not the main descriptive anchor for the chapter.

## CAPR formulation versus literature

The literature supports the corridor unevenly.

`SC066` is the closest match to handbook material. Campbell, Ringe and Taylor,
Luick, and Sievers-Brunner all treat medial-vowel syncope as a real late OE
process, and the `nettle` / `netele` type fits that tradition well.

`SC068` is also historically intelligible, but usually as a consequence rather
than as an independently named law. Hogg and Ringe and Taylor both describe the
simplification of heavy consonant clusters after syncope, and Ringe and Taylor
state the degemination point most directly.

`SC067` is the least book-ready member. The rule itself is simple and plausible:
once syncope creates a `tθ` cluster, assimilation can reduce it. But the
handbooks normally subsume such cleanup under broader discussions of
post-syncope assimilation and simplification, not under a distinct chapter-like
sound law. In other words:

1. the corridor is historically natural as **late syncope plus downstream cluster cleanup**;
2. the exact three-stage segmentation is mostly **CAPR sharpening**;
3. `SC067` may ultimately prove to be a bridge section inside a corridor report rather than an equal co-headliner with `SC066` and `SC068`.

## Chronology implications

The chronology cards and the literature line up well at two points and weakly at
one.

1. `SC066` must follow `SC055` OE I Umlaut. This matches the handbook claim that the relevant syncope is later than umlaut-sensitive developments. The card's `nettle` and `spindle` failures make that dependency concrete.
2. `SC066` must precede `SC068`. This is strongly model-supported by `spindle`, and it also fits the broader handbook logic that syncope can create an over-heavy cluster whose simplification belongs downstream.
3. `SC067` has no positive first-break boundary in either direction. Its current card therefore contributes less as chronology evidence than as a reminder that some local cleanup rules are computationally real without yet being chapter-defining historical anchors.

The evidence therefore divides into two types.

- **Literature-supported history:** late weak-vowel reduction, medial syncope, and subsequent consonant-cluster simplification belong together in broad historical terms.
- **Model-level order evidence:** the exact local claim `SC066 < SC068`, and the placement of `SC067` as an intermediate cleanup stage, are CAPR-specific articulations supported by the current derivational corpus.

That means an eventual production report can make a strong historical claim for
the corridor as a whole, but should present the three-rule segmentation with
care.

## Open questions

1. Should the eventual production report keep all three rules in one chapter, or should `SC066` + `SC068` form the true core while `SC067` becomes an internal bridge note?
2. Is `SC067` historically central enough to share top billing, or is it mainly a CAPR/local-cascade articulation of a cleanup step?
3. How much should the eventual prose foreground `spindle`, given that it is the clearest local chronology witness for `SC066 < SC068`?
4. Should `SC068` be presented as part of the syncope narrative, or as a subordinate note on post-syncope cluster simplification and degemination?
5. How book-facing should the chapter label be: **Syncope and Degemination Corridor**, **Late weak-tail syncope corridor**, or something even more explicitly Old English?
