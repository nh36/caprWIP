- Nearby heading: #### B. Why this is the right temporary decision

```text
3274: The TSV needs a form that actually yields the conservative OE output through the pipeline's sound changes. The pre-OE transponent \*stebn- (with root *e* already present, and the *-bn-* cluster that regularly becomes *-fn-*) satisfies this requirement:
3275: 
3276: - `stebnō → stefn` — pipeline output matches the attested conservative OE form
3277: - No new rules needed; *bn → fn is already handled
3278: - The root *e* is inherited (not produced by umlaut or other mechanism)

```text
84: **Luick (§78, Anm. 3)** engages directly with Bülbring's proposal and rejects it. He argues for paradigmatic leveling instead: doublet forms arose because paradigms had both u-preserving (high-vowel suffix) and u-lowering (non-high suffix) forms; near labials and gutturals, the u-forms were preferred. He explicitly cites the counterexamples that make Bülbring's phonological conditioning untenable: *wolcen, folc, folġian, folde, folm, bolla, bolt, bolster, molde, molcen, smolt* — all have labial or velar environments but regular lowering.
85: 
86: **R/T (§2.3.1, pp.32-33 / our OCR pp.47-48)** agree these are genuine exceptions but reach a different conclusion about paradigmatic leveling. They find it "implausible" for a-stem nouns, arguing that the only case-forms with high-vowel suffixes are functionally marginal: inst.sg. *-u, dat.pl. *-umaz, inst.pl. *-umiz. They conclude: "We do not really know why *u failed to lower in these forms."

- Nearby heading: ### Could we use paradigm forms? (Why we decided not to)

```text
90: For other problematic items (fire, brand, berry, thorn), we successfully resolved mismatches by adopting a paradigm form in which the phonological development is lautgesetzlich. The question is whether the same approach works for the u-lowering exceptions.
91: 
92: **Approach A: Use a u-stem or root-noun form.**
93: R/T notes that u-stems and root nouns regularly preserve *u because their paradigms have predominantly high-vowel suffixes (nom.sg. *-uz, acc.sg. *-ŷ, gen.sg. *-iz, dat.sg. *-i, nom.pl. *-iz, etc.). For example, *lustuz (u-stem nom.sg.) → OE lust with preserved u (R/T p.45). If *wulf-, *fugl-, or *bukk- were u-stems, we could use the nom.sg. in *-uz.

96: - Kroonen reconstructs *wulfa- (a-stem; p.598), *fugla- (a-stem), and *bukka(n)- (originally n-stem; p.98) — none as u-stems.
97: - There is no Gothic or comparative evidence for u-stem inflection of these words. Gothic wulfs is an a-stem, Gothic fugls is an a-stem.
98: - Using a u-stem nom.sg. would require us to posit a stem-class that is not attested in any daughter language. This would be philologically indefensible.
