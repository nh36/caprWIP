```text
84: **Luick (§78, Anm. 3)** engages directly with Bülbring's proposal and rejects it. He argues for paradigmatic leveling instead: doublet forms arose because paradigms had both u-preserving (high-vowel suffix) and u-lowering (non-high suffix) forms; near labials and gutturals, the u-forms were preferred. He explicitly cites the counterexamples that make Bülbring's phonological conditioning untenable: *wolcen, folc, folġian, folde, folm, bolla, bolt, bolster, molde, molcen, smolt* — all have labial or velar environments but regular lowering.
85: 
86: **R/T (§2.3.1, pp.32-33 / our OCR pp.47-48)** agree these are genuine exceptions but reach a different conclusion about paradigmatic leveling. They find it "implausible" for a-stem nouns, arguing that the only case-forms with high-vowel suffixes are functionally marginal: inst.sg. *-u, dat.pl. *-umaz, inst.pl. *-umiz. They conclude: "We do not really know why *u failed to lower in these forms."
