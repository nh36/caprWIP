## Method

This pass went beyond tightening 01 by sweeping all current broad Clark Hall and Bright occurrences, plus the regular-overlay Kroonen and Orel occurrences, against the rebuilt compact-alpha baseline. Regular prose was tightened upstream in `book_prose/regular_all_01/`; non-regular fixes were made in the relevant `.model.md` files and paired support files.

Page locators were added only where the local page-marked OCR showed the exact headword, paradigm form, or comparative headword cleanly enough to support the reader-facing sentence. No OCR line numbers, file offsets, search-result positions, image-page guesses, or inferred page ranges were used.

## Source-by-source results

### Kroonen2013
- broad occurrences before: **76**
- inspected: **36**
- locators added: **15**
- left broad: **61**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Regular-overlay dictionary cases were inspected source-by-source. Remaining broad cases are mostly non-regular occurrences not inspected here, plus regular claims where the headword page did not isolate the exact sentence cleanly.

### Orel2003
- broad occurrences before: **47**
- inspected: **18**
- locators added: **2**
- left broad: **45**
- reason for remaining broad cases: This pass inspected the regular-overlay Orel cases only. Remaining broad Orel occurrences are mostly outside the regular overlay, with a smaller regular remainder where the headword page did not isolate the exact claim cleanly.

### ClarkHall1960
- broad occurrences before: **83**
- inspected: **83**
- locators added: **26**
- left broad: **57**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Clark Hall was swept across all current broad occurrences; most survivors are exact-headword misses or cases where the page was found but the sentence-level claim remained too loose to tighten safely.

### BrightCassidyRingler1971
- broad occurrences before: **16**
- inspected: **16**
- locators added: **10**
- left broad: **6**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Bright was swept across all current broad occurrences; the remaining broad cases are the few entries where a safe page anchor was not isolated tightly enough for the exact reader-facing claim.

### RingeTaylor2014
- broad occurrences before: **93**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **93**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Broad Ringe & Taylor citations remain largely handbook-style rule or discussion citations and were not the bulk-localization target of this pass.

### Campbell1959
- broad occurrences before: **66**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **66**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Broad Campbell citations remain largely grammar-rule or discussion citations and were not the bulk-localization target of this pass.

### Fulk2018
- broad occurrences before: **9**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **9**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Only a few Fulk claims are tightly anchorable; the remaining broad cases stay discussion-level.

### SieversBrunner1965
- broad occurrences before: **24**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **24**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Remaining Brunner cases are mostly grammar-level references rather than single-page headword citations.

### BosworthToller1898
- broad occurrences before: **31**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **31**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Bosworth-Toller remains mixed because of base/supplement complications; untouched cases remain broad unless a page-safe local witness is explicit.

### Hogg1992
- broad occurrences before: **5**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **5**
- reason for remaining broad cases: The surviving Hogg citations are discussion-level and were not retightened in this pass.

### Luick1914
- broad occurrences before: **1**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **1**
- reason for remaining broad cases: The Luick tail was not revisited in this pass.

### KlugeSeebold2011
- broad occurrences before: **12**
- inspected: **0**
- locators added: **0**
- left broad: **12**
- reason for remaining broad cases: Kluge-Seebold remains page-quarantined in this pass.
