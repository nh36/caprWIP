## Generated broad-row work

| Source | Rows inspected | Locators added | Citations removed | Broad retained | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| Kroonen2013 | 10 | 3 | 0 | 7 | Two shilling rows and the youth row were localized; several comparative-headword rows remain broad and need either page recovery or project-framing softening. |
| Orel2003 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 3 | Gang was localized to p. 164; span’s Orel row was removed as redundant; loam/neck/world still need direct article recovery. |
| BosworthToller1898 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Fright and hammer gained locators; the fly row and one duplicate hammer dictionary half were removed as redundant; think and loam remain broad. |
| ClarkHall1960 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 0 | Fright, meed, and span gained locators; swan and ban no longer need a broad Clark Hall duplicate. |
| KlugeSeebold2011 | 9 | 0 | 1 | 8 | All remaining Kluge rows were re-verified in the OCR witness; none can yet be paginated safely. |
| Campbell1959 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 | Remaining rows are claim-complex handbook prose, not dictionary headwords; they need sentence splitting or section isolation. |
| RingeTaylor2014 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 11 | Remaining rows are mostly class-history or analogical-background sentences and were left for a future claim-isolation pass. |
| Hogg1992 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | Both remaining Hogg rows are broad background-form-note support, not missing-evidence crises. |
| Fulk2018 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | Remaining Fulk rows support handbook-style formation claims and were not isolated further in this pass. |
| SieversBrunner1965 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | Remaining Sievers-Brunner rows are paradigm/background claims that still need targeted section recovery. |
| BrightCassidyRingler1971 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | The reopened show (3sg) row was localized to p. 383. |
| Kroonen2011 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | The reopened knob row was localized to p. 297. |

## Undercitation audit

The watchlist review is recorded in `citation_locator_undercitation_watchlist_02.md`. The broad-citation work in this pass did **not** justify removing support merely to lower the count. Most watchlist entries remained adequately cited; where a surviving sentence still sounded too source-backed, the prose was softened rather than propped up with a guessed locator.

### `find / fundene`

`find / fundene` remains adequately cited after audit 02. The entry now rests on `RingeTaylor2014, 344` for the inherited verb line, `BosworthToller1898, 219` for attested `fundene`, and `ClarkHall1960, 124` for the participial stem background. Audit 02 further softened the phrase “not the cleanest inherited comparison” to make the cell choice explicitly project framing rather than an uncited scholarly claim, and Luick/Brunner were **not** restored.

| town / tūn | SieversBrunner1965 | This surviving SieversBrunner1965 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: Kroonen cites _\*tūna-_ 'fenced area', while Orel gives _\*tūnan_ ~ _\*tūnaz_ [@Kroonen2013, 566; @Orel2003, 452]. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |
| warp / weorpan | RingeTaylor2014 | This surviving RingeTaylor2014 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: Ringe and Taylor distinguish preterite _\*warp_ from infinitive _\*werpana_, and the selected input here is the verbal form _\*wérpaną_ [@RingeTaylor2014]. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |
| three / þrīe | Kroonen2013 | This surviving Kroonen2013 citation now sits only on comparative-headword or staging prose: Kroonen cites the numeral under a broader stem-style reconstruction rather than under one Old English-ready paradigm cell [@Kroonen2013]. | yes | Either recover the exact article page or soften the sentence to explicit project framing. |
| breast / brēost | Campbell1959 | This surviving Campbell1959 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: From _\*bréustą_, the regular Old English development gives _brēost_, with the expected _eu_ > _ēo_ vowel history [@Campbell1959]. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |
| dill / dile | Kroonen2013 | This surviving Kroonen2013 citation now sits only on comparative-headword or staging prose: Kroonen treats the word as preserving evidence for both an i-stem and a ja-stem formation, with Old English _dile_ on one side and continental forms such as Old Saxon _dilli_ and Old High German _tilli_ on the other [@Kroonen2013]. | yes | Either recover the exact article page or soften the sentence to explicit project framing. |
| dill / dile | Fulk2018 | This surviving Fulk2018 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: That stem-class distinction matters for the Old English consonant shape. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |

| neck / hnecca | Orel2003 | The Orel row remains broad because the exact comparative article was not safely recoverable from the current witness. | yes | Retain broad for now and revisit with a better headword recovery. |
| needle / nǣdl | Hogg1992 | This surviving Hogg1992 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: Clark Hall records the attested citation form _nǣdl_ [@ClarkHall1960, 210]. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |

| fright / fyrhte | Campbell1959 | This surviving Campbell1959 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: From _\*fúrxtīnaz_, the oblique in-stem develops through the loss and weakening of the final ending and the regular OE history summarized by Campbell as _-e < -i < -in_ in this class of abstracts [@Campbell1959]. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |
| have / hæfeþ | Kroonen2013 | The surviving Kroonen citation still supports comparative verb-family background but was not page-recoverable in this pass. | yes | Leave broad until the exact comparative verb entry can be recovered safely. |
| have / hæfeþ | Fulk2018 | This surviving Fulk2018 citation still supports a combined scholarly claim rather than a single isolated fact: The selected input _\*xábēθi_ is therefore the 3sg present cell rather than a rephrasing of the infinitive. | yes | Split the sentence or isolate the exact rule/example before adding a page or section locator. |

## Upstream-only broad citations

Upstream-only broad occurrences rose from **201** to **213** because generated broad rows were reduced faster than upstream-only source prose was cleaned. The remaining upstream-only broad rows are now mostly model-entry-only or source-only analytical background that does not surface in the compact generated volume. They deserve a separate cleanup pass, but they are no longer the main blocker for trusting the generated citation state.

## Safety checks

- No OCR line numbers were used as locators.
- No file offsets were used as locators.
- No search-result positions were used as locators.
- No unverified PDF page indexes were used as locators.
- No invented page ranges were introduced.
- Every new locator added in this pass has a corresponding row in `citation_locator_primary_source_evidence.tsv`.
- Generated Markdown and `citation_locator_remaining_master.tsv` are synchronized to the final rebuilt state of this pass.

## Recommendation

**A. Continue generated broad-citation locator work.** Audit 02 materially reduced the live generated queue (64 -> 47), verified that the remaining Kluge rows are witness-limited rather than neglected, and kept the undercitation watchlist stable. The next efficient step is another generated-output pass focused on the remaining handbook rows and the unresolved Kroonen/Orel/Bosworth dictionary survivors, not an upstream-only cleanup yet.
